## üöÄ Quickstart

1. **Install Medusa CLI**
    ```bash
    npm install -g @medusajs/medusa-cli
    ```
2. **Create a new Medusa project**
    ```
    medusa new my-medusa-store --seed
    ```
3. **Start your Medusa engine**
    ```bash
    medusa develop
    ```
    
4. **Use the API**
    ```bash
    curl localhost:9000/store/products | python -m json.tool
    ```

After these four steps and only a couple of minutes, you now have a complete commerce engine running locally. You may now explore [the documentation](https://docs.medusa-commerce.com/api) to learn how to interact with the Medusa API. You may also add [plugins](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/master/packages) to your Medusa store by specifying them in your `medusa-config.js` file.

## üõí Setting up a storefront for your Medusa engine
Medusa is a headless commerce engine which means that it can be used for any type of digital commerce experience - you may use it as the backend for an app, a voice application, social commerce experiences or a traditional e-commerce website, you may even want to integrate Medusa into your own software to enable commerce functionality. All of these are use cases that Medusa supports - to learn more read the documentation or reach out.

To provide a quick way to get you started with a storefront install one of our traditional e-commerce starters:

- [Gatsby Starter](https://github.com/medusajs/gatsby-starter-medusa)
  ```
  npm install -g gatsby-cli
  gatsby new my-medusa-storefront https://github.com/medusajs/gatsby-starter-medusa
  ```
- [Nextjs Starter](https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa)
  ```
  npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa my-medusa-storefront
  ```

With your starter and your Medusa store running you can open http://localhost:8000 (for Gatsby) or http://localhost:3000 (for Nextjs) in your browser and view the products in your store, build a cart, add shipping details and pay and complete an order.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Linking development to Medusa Cloud
With your project in local development you can link your Medusa instance to Medusa Cloud - this will allow you to manage your store, view orders and test out the amazing functionalities that you are building. Linking your project to Medusa Cloud requires that you have a Medusa Cloud account.

1. **Authenticate your CLI with Medusa Cloud:**
   ```
   medusa login
   ```
2. **Link project**
   ```
   medusa link --develop
   ```

You can now navigate to Orders in Medusa Cloud to view the orders in your local Medusa project, just like you would if your store was running in production.

## Database support
In production Medusa requires Postgres and Redis, but SQLite is supported for development and testing purposes. If you plan on using Medusa for a project it is recommended that you install Postgres and Redis on your dev machine.

- [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Install Redis](https://redis.io/download)

To use Postgres and Redis you should provide a `database_url` and `redis_url` in your `medusa-config.js`.
