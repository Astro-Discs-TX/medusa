# {metadata.title}

This guide provides some troubleshooting step as to why your admin widget / UI route isn't showing in the Medusa Admin dashboard.

## Incorrect Zone

If you're adding an admin widget, make sure you're using a correct zone.

Refer to the [Admin Widget Injection Zones list](../../../admin-widget-injection-zones/page.mdx) for reference.

---

## Incorrect Function Definition

Widget and UI routes must be defined as arrow functions. Any other type of declaration isn't accepted.

Refer to the [Admin Development Constraints](!docs!/advanced-development/admin/constraints) documentation for more details.

---

## Incorrect Type of Zone Value

A widget zone's value must be wrapped in double or single quotes:

```ts
export const config = defineWidgetConfig({
  zone: "product.details.before",
})
```

Any other usage leads to the widget not being shown.

Refer to the [Admin Development Constraints](!docs!/advanced-development/admin/constraints) documentation for more details.
