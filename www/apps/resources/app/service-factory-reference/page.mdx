# {metadata.title}

This document provides a reference of the methods generated for a service that extends the service factory (`MedusaService`), and how to use them.

<Note title="Tip">

Learn more about the service factory in [this documentation](!docs!/advanced-development/modules/service-factory).

</Note>

## Method Names

Generated method names are of the format `{operationName}_{dataModelName}`, where:

- `{operationName}` is the name of the operation. For example, `create`.
- `{dataModelName}` is the pascal-case version of the data model's key that's passed in the object parameter of `MedusaService`. Except for the `retrieve` operation, the name is pluralized for other methods.

Some examples of method names:

- `createPosts`
- `createMyPosts`
- `retrievePost`
- `listPosts`

## Methods Reference

<Note>

The reference uses only the operation name to refer to the method.
