This method updates one or more records of the data model.

## Update One Record

```ts
const post = await customModuleService.updatePosts({
  id: "123",
  name: "My Post"
})
```

To update one record, pass an object that at least has an `id` property, identifying the ID of the record to update.

You can pass in the same object any other properties to update.

The method returns the updated record as an object.

---

## Update Multiple Records

```ts
const posts = await customModuleService.updatePosts([
  {
    id: "123",
    name: "My Post"
  },
  {
    id: "321",
    published_at: new Date()
  }
])
```

To update multiple records, pass an array of objects. Each object has at least an `id` property, identifying the ID of the record to update.

You can pass in each object any other properties to update.

The method returns an array of objects of updated records.

## Update Records Matching a Filter

```ts
const posts = await customModuleService.updatePosts({
  selector: {
    name: "My Post"
  },
  data: {
    published_at: new Date()
  }
})
```

To update records that match specified filters, pass an object having two properties:

{/* TODO add a link to filtering */}

- `selector`: An object of filters that a record must match to be updated.
- `data`: An object of the properties to update in every record that match the filters in `selector`.

The method returns an array of objects of updated records.

---

## Multiple Record Updates with Filters

```ts
const posts = await customModuleService.updatePosts([
  {
    selector: {
      name: "My Post"
    },
    data: {
      published_at: new Date()
    }
  },
  {
    selector: {
      name: "Another Post"
    },
    data: {
      metadata: {
        external_id: "123"
      }
    }
  }
])
```

To update records matching different set of filters, pass an array of objects, each having two properties:

{/* TODO add a link to filtering */}

- `selector`: An object of filters that a record must match to be updated.
- `data`: An object of the properties to update in every record that match the filters in `selector`.

The method returns an array of objects of updated records.
