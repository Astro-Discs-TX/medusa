# {metadata.title}

In this document, you'll learn how to retrieve product variant prices in the Medusa application using the [Query](!docs!/advanced-development/modules/query).

<Note title="Why use Query?">

The Product Module doesn't provide pricing functionalities. The Medusa application links the Product Module's `ProductVariant` data model to the Pricing Module's `PriceSet` data model.

So, to retrieve data across the linked records of the two modules, you use Query.

</Note>

## Retrieve All Product Variant Prices

To retrieve all product variant prices, retrieve the product using Query and include among its fields `variants.prices.*`.

For example:

```ts highlights={[["6"]]}
const { data: products } = await query.graph({
  entryPoint: "product",
  fields: [
    "*",
    "variants.*",
    "variants.prices.*",
  ],
  variables: {
    filters: {
      id: [
        "prod_123",
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

Each variant in the retrieved products has a `prices` array property with all the product variant prices. Each price object has the properties of the [Pricing Module's Price data model](/references/pricing/models/Price).

## Retrieve Calculated Price for a Context

The Pricing Module can calculate prices of a variant based on a [context](../../../pricing/price-calculation/page.mdx#calculation-context), such as the region ID or the currency code.

<Note title="Tip">

Learn more about prices calculation in [this Pricing Module documentation](../../../pricing/price-calculation/page.mdx).

</Note>

To retrieve calculated prices of variants based on a context, retrieve the products using Query and:

- Pass `variants.calculated_price.*` in the `fields` property.
- Pass in the `variables` property a `variants.calculated_price` property whose value is the [calculation context object](../../../pricing/price-calculation/page.mdx#calculation-context).

For example:

```ts highlights={[["6"], ["12"], ["13"], ["14"], ["15"], ["16"], ["17"]]}
const { data: products } = await query.graph({
  entryPoint: "product",
  fields: [
    "*",
    "variants.*",
    "variants.calculated_price.*",
  ],
  variables: {
    filters: {
      id: "prod_123",
    },
    "variants.calculated_price": {
      context: {
        region_id: "reg_01J3MRPDNXXXDSCC76Y6YCZARS",
        currency_code: "eur",
      },
    },
  },
})
```

The `variants.calculated_price` property of `variables` is an object that has a `context` property. `context`'s value is an object whose keys are price rules, such as `region_id`, and value is the rule's value in this context, such as the customer's region's ID.

Each variant in the retrieved products has a `calculated_price` object. Learn more about its properties in [this Pricing Module guide](../../../pricing/price-calculation/page.mdx#returned-price-object).
