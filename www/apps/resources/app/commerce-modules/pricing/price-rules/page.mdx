# {metadata.title}

In this Pricing Module guide, you'll learn about price rules for price sets and price lists, and how to add rules to a price.

## Price Rule

You can restrict prices by rules. Each rule of a price is represented by the [PriceRule data model](/references/pricing/models/PriceRule).

The `Price` data model has a `rules_count` property, which indicates how many rules, represented by `PriceRule`, are applied to the price.

For exmaple, you create a price restricted to `10557` zip codes.

A price can have multiple price rules.

For example, a price can be restricted by a region and a zip code.

## Price List Rules

Rules applied to a price list are represented by the [PriceListRule data model](/references/pricing/models/PriceListRule).

The `rules_count` property of a `PriceList` indicates how many rules are applied to it.

## How to Set Rules on a Price?

### Using Workflows

Medusa uses the Pricing Module to store prices of different resources, such as product variants and shipping options.

When you manage one of these resources using [Medusa's workflows](../../../medusa-workflows-reference/page.mdx) or using the API routes that use them, you can set rules on a price using the `rules` property of the price object.

For example, when creating a shipping option using the [createShippingOptionsWorkflow](!resources!/references/medusa-workflows/createShippingOptionsWorkflow) to create a shipping option, you can make the shipping price free based on the cart total:

export const workflowHighlights = [
  ["19", "rules", "The default price doesn't have rules."],
  ["26", "item_total", "Apply the price if the cart or order's total matches the condition."]
]

```ts highlights={workflowHighlights}
const { result } = await createShippingOptionsWorkflow(container)
  .run({
    input: [{
      name: "Standard Shipping",
      service_zone_id: "serzo_123",
      shipping_profile_id: "sp_123",
      provider_id: "prov_123",
      type: {
        label: "Standard",
        description: "Standard shipping",
        code: "standard",
      },
      price_type: "flat",
      prices: [
        // default price
        {
          currency_code: "usd",
          amount: 10,
          rules: {},
        },
        // price if cart total >= $100
        {
          currency_code: "usd",
          amount: 0,
          rules: {
            item_total: {
              operator: "gte",
              value: 100,
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    }],
  })
```

In this example, you create a shipping option whose default price is `$10`. When the total of the cart or order using this shipping option is greater than `$100`, the shipping option's price becomes free.

### Using Pricing Module's Service

<Note>

For most use cases, it's recommended to use [workflows](#using-workflows) instead of directly using the module's service.

</Note>

When adding a price using the [addPrices](!resources!/references/pricing/addPrices) method of the Pricing Module's service, pass the `rules` property to a price object.

For example:

```ts
const priceSet = await pricingModule.addPrices({
  priceSetId: "pset_1",
  prices: [
    // default price
    {
      currency_code: "usd",
      amount: 10,
      rules: {},
    },
    // price if cart total >= $100
    {
      currency_code: "usd",
      amount: 0,
      rules: {
        item_total: {
          operator: "gte",
          value: 100,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

In this example, you set the default price of a resource (for example, a shipping option), to `$10`. You also add a conditioned price that sets the price to `0` when the cart or order's total is greater than or equal to `$100`.

### How is the Price Rule Applied?

The [price calculation](../price-calculation/page.mdx) mechanism considers a price applicable when the resource that this price is in matches the specified rules.

For example, a [cart object](!api!/store#carts_cart_schema) has an `item_total` property. So, if a shipping option has the following price:

```json
{
  "currency_code": "usd",
  "amount": 0,
  "rules": {
    "item_total": {
      "operator": "gte",
      "value": 100,
    }
  }
}
```

The shipping option's price is applied when the cart's `item_total` is greater than or equal to `$100`.

You can also apply the rule on nested relations and properties. For example, to apply a shipping option's price based on the customer's group, you can apply a rule on the `customer.group.id` attribute:

```json
{
  "currency_code": "usd",
  "amount": 0,
  "rules": {
    "customer.group.id": {
      "operator": "eq",
      "value": "cusgrp_123"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the price is only applied if a cart's customer belongs to the customer group of ID `cusgrp_123`.

<Note>

These same rules apply to product variant prices as well, or any other resource that has a price.
