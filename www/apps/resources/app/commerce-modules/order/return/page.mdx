## What is a Return?

A return is the return of items delivered to the customer back to the merchant. It is represented by the `Return` data model.

A return is requested either by the customer or the merchant, supporting an automated Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) flow.

Once the merchant receives the returned items, they mark the return as received.

## Return Shipping Methods

A return has shipping methods used to return the items to the merchant. The shipping methods are represented by the `OrderShippingMethod` data model.

## Returns in Exchanges and Claims

When a merchant creates an exchange or a claim, it includes returning items from the customer.

The `Return` data model also represents the return of these items. In this case, the return is associated with the exchange or claim it was created for.
