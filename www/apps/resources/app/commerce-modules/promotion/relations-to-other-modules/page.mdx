When Commerce Modules are used together in a Medusa application, the Medusa application handles building the relations between these modules.

This document showcases the relation between the Promotion Module and other Commerce Modules.

## Cart Module

A promotion can be applied on line items and shipping methods of a cart. Medusa defines a link module that builds a relationship between the `Cart`, `LineItemAdjustment`, and `Promotion` data models.
