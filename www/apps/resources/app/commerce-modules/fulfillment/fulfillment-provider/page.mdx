## What is a Fulfillment Module Provider?

A fulfillment module provider handles fulfilling items, typically using a third-party integration.

Fulfillment module providers registered in the Fulfillment Module's [options](../module-options/page.mdx) are stored and represented by the [FulfillmentProvider data model](/references/fulfillment/models/FulfillmentProvider).

## Default Fulfillment Provider

Medusa provides a Manual Fulfillment Provider that acts as a placeholder fulfillment provider. It doesn't process fulfillment and delegates that to the merchant.

This provider is installed by default in your application and you can use it to fulfill items manually.

<Note title="Tip">

The identifier of the manual fulfillment provider is `fp_manual_manual`.

## How to Create a Custom Fulfillment Provider?

A fulfillment module provider is a module whose service implements the `IFulfillmentProvider` imported from `@medusajs/framework/types`.

The module can have multiple fulfillment provider services, where each are registered as separate fulfillment providers.

Refer to the [Create Fulfillment Module Provider](/references/fulfillment/provider) guide to learn how to create a fulfillment module provider.

After you create a fulfillment provider, you can choose it as the default fulfillment module provider for a stock location in the Medusa Admin dashboard.

## How are Fulfillment Providers Registered?

### Configure Fulfillment Module's Providers

The Fulfillment Module accepts a `providers` option that allows you to configure the providers registered in your application.

Learn more about this option in the [Module Options](../module-options/page.mdx) guide.

### Registration on Application Start

When the Medusa application starts, it registers the fulfillment module providers defined in the `providers` option of the Fulfillment Module.

For each fulfillment module provider, the Medusa application finds all fulfillment provider services defined in them to register.

### FulfillmentProvider Data Model

A registered fulfillment provider is represented by the [FulfillmentProvider data model](/references/fulfillment/models/FulfillmentProvider) in the Medusa application.

This data model is used to reference a service in the fulfillment module provider and determine whether it's installed in the application.

![Diagram showcasing the FulfillmentProvider data model](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1746794803/Medusa%20Resources/fulfillment-provider-model_wo2ato.jpg)

The `FulfillmentProvider` data model has the following properties:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the fulfillment provider. The ID's format is `fp_{identifier}_{id}`, where:
    - `identifier` is the value of the `identifier` property in the fulfillment module provider's service.
    - `id` is the value of the `id` property of the fulfillment module provider in `medusa-config.ts`.
- `is_enabled`: A boolean indicating whether the fulfillment provider is enabled.

### How to Remove a Fulfillment Provider?

You can remove a registered fulfillment provider from the Medusa application by removing it from the `providers` option in the Fulfillment Module's configuration.

Then, the next time the Medusa application starts, it will set the `is_enabled` property of the `FulfillmentProvider`'s record to `false`. This allows you to re-enable the fulfillment provider later if needed by adding it back to the `providers` option.
