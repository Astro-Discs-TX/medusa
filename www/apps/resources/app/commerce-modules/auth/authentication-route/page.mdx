In this document, you'll learn about the authentication routes and how to use them to create or log-in users.

## Register Route

The Medusa application defines an API route at `/auth/{actor_type}/{provider}/register` that creates an auth identity for an actor type, such as a `customer`. It returns a JWT token that you pass to an API route that creates the user.

For example, if you're registering a customer, you:

1. Send a request to `/auth/customer/emailpass/register` to retrieve the registration JWT token.
2. Send a request to the [Create Customer API route](!api!/store#customers_postcustomers) to create the customer, passing the [JWT token in the header](!api!/store#authentication).

### Path Parameters

Its path parameters are:

- `{actor_type}`: the actor type of the user you're authenticating. For example, `customer`.
- `{provider}`: the auth provider to handle the authentication. For example, `emailpass`.

### Request Body Parameters

This route accepts in the request body the data that the specified authentication provider requires to handle authentication.

For example, the EmailPass provider requires an `email` and `password` fields in the request body.

### Response Fields

If the authentication is successful, you'll receive a `token` field in the response body object:

```json
{
  "token": "..."
}
```

## Auth Route

The Medusa application defines an API route at `/auth/{actor_type}/{provider}` that authenticates a user of an actor type. It returns a JWT token that can be passed in [the header of subsequent requests](!api!/store#authentication) to send authenticated requests.

For example, if you're authenticating a customer, you send a request to `/auth/customer/emailpass`.

### Path Parameters

Its path parameters are:

- `{actor_type}`: the actor type of the user you're authenticating. For example, `customer`.
- `{provider}`: the auth provider to handle the authentication. For example, `emailpass`.

### Request Body Parameters

This route accepts in the request body the data that the specified authentication provider requires to handle authentication.

For example, the EmailPass provider requires an `email` and `password` fields in the request body.

### Response Fields

If the authentication is successful, you'll receive a `token` field in the response body object:

```json
{
  "token": "..."
}
```
