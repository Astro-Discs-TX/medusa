In this document, you'll learn about the authentication routes and how to use them to create or log-in users.

<Note>

These routes are added by Medusa's application layer, not the Auth Module.

</Note>

## Types of Authentication Flows

### 1. Basic Authentication Flow

This authentication flow doesn't require validation with third-party services.

It requires the following steps:

1. Registering the user with the [Register Route](#register-route).
2. Authenticating the user with the [Auth Route](#auth-route).

### 2. Third-Party Service Authenticate Flow

This authentication flow authenticates the user with a third-party service, such as Google.

It requires the following steps:

1. Authenticate the user with the [Auth Route](#auth-route).
2. If the authentication requires more action with the third-party service:
    1. The auth route redirects to the third-party service's authentication portal. The URL is returned by the Auth Module Provider.
    2. Once the authentication with the third-party service finishes, it redirects back to the [Callback Route](#callback-route). So, make sure your third-party service is configured to redirect to the [Callback Route](#callback-route).
    3. If the callback validation is successful, you'll receive the authentication token.

You may then use the [Auth Route](#auth-route) for subsequent authentication.

## Register Route

The Medusa application defines an API route at `/auth/{actor_type}/{provider}/register` that creates an auth identity for an actor type, such as a `customer`. It returns a JWT token that you pass to an API route that creates the user.

<Note>

This API route is useful for providers like `emailpass` that uses custom logic to authenticate a user. For authentication providers that authenticate with third-party services, such as Google, use the [Auth Route](#auth-route) instead.

</Note>

For example, if you're registering a customer, you:

1. Send a request to `/auth/customer/emailpass/register` to retrieve the registration JWT token.
2. Send a request to the [Create Customer API route](!api!/store#customers_postcustomers) to create the customer, passing the [JWT token in the header](!api!/store#authentication).

### Path Parameters

Its path parameters are:

- `{actor_type}`: the actor type of the user you're authenticating. For example, `customer`.
- `{provider}`: the auth provider to handle the authentication. For example, `emailpass`.

### Request Body Parameters

This route accepts in the request body the data that the specified authentication provider requires to handle authentication.

For example, the EmailPass provider requires an `email` and `password` fields in the request body.

### Response Fields

If the authentication is successful, you'll receive a `token` field in the response body object:

```json
{
  "token": "..."
}
```

## Auth Route

The Medusa application defines an API route at `/auth/{actor_type}/{provider}` that authenticates a user of an actor type. It returns a JWT token that can be passed in [the header of subsequent requests](!api!/store#authentication) to send authenticated requests.

For example, if you're authenticating a customer, you send a request to `/auth/customer/emailpass`.

### Path Parameters

Its path parameters are:

- `{actor_type}`: the actor type of the user you're authenticating. For example, `customer`.
- `{provider}`: the auth provider to handle the authentication. For example, `emailpass`.

### Request Body Parameters

This route accepts in the request body the data that the specified authentication provider requires to handle authentication.

For example, the EmailPass provider requires an `email` and `password` fields in the request body.

### Response Fields

If the authentication is successful, you'll receive a `token` field in the response body object:

```json
{
  "token": "..."
}
```

## Validate Callback Route

The Medusa application defines an API route at `/auth/{actor_type}/{provider}/callback` that's useful for authenticating users with third-party services, such as Google.

When integrating with a third-party service, you use [Auth Route](#auth-route) first to authenticate the user. If the authentication requires more action with the third-party provider, the request redirects to the authentication provider's authentication portal.

<Note title="Tip">

The URL of the authentication portal is received from the Auth Module Provider.

</Note>

Once the authentication with the third-party provider finishes, it should redirect back to this API route. So, make sure to add the necessary configuration in your provider to ensure this flow.

### Path Parameters

Its path parameters are:

- `{actor_type}`: the actor type of the user you're authenticating. For example, `customer`.
- `{provider}`: the auth provider to handle the authentication. For example, `google`.

### Request Body Parameters

This route accepts in the request body the data from the third-party service, and passes it along to the authentication provider to validate whether the customer was authenticated.

### Response Fields

If the authentication is successful, you'll receive a `token` field in the response body object:

```json
{
  "token": "..."
}
```
