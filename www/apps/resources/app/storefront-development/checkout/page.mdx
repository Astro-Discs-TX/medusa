Once a customer finishes adding products to cart, they go through the checkout flow to place their order.

The checkout flow is composed of four steps:

1. **Email:** Enter customer email. For logged-in customer, this can be pre-filled.
2. **Shipping:** Enter shipping/billing address details, then choose a shipping method.
3. **Payment:** Choose a payment option, and perform any payment action necessary (for example, enter card details).
4. **Complete Cart:** Complete cart and place the order.

While it's up to you in how you implement the checkout flow, it's highly recommended to follow these steps in order.
