The Medusa application is made up of a Node.js service and an admin dashboard. The storefront is installed, built, and hosted separately from the Medusa application, providing you with the flexibility to choose the frontend tech stack that you and your team are proficient in, and implement unique design systems and user experience. 

<Note>

Learn more about Medusa's architecture in [this documentation](!docs!/learn/introduction/architecture).

</Note>

You can build your storefront from scratch, or build it on top of the [Next.js Starter storefront](../nextjs-starter/page.mdx). This section of the documentation provides guides to help you build a storefront from scratch for your Medusa application.

## Using the JS SDK

All guides under this documentation section use the JS SDK to interact with the Medusa application's Store API Routes. The JS SDK is a NPM package that facilitates interacting with the backend's REST APIs. You can use it in any JavaScript framework, such as Next.js, React, Vue, or Angular.

To install and set up the JS SDK, refer to the [JS SDK documentation](../js-sdk/page.mdx).
