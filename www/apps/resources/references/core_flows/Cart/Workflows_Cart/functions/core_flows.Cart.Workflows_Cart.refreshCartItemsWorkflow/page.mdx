# refreshCartItemsWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `refreshCartItemsWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow refreshes a cart to ensure its prices, promotion codes, taxes, and other details are applied correctly. It's useful
after making a chnge to a cart, such as after adding an item to the cart or adding a promotion code.

This workflow is used by other cart-related workflows, such as the [addToCartWorkflow](../core_flows.Cart.Workflows_Cart.addToCartWorkflow/page.mdx) after an item
is added to the cart.

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to refresh the cart after making updates to it in your
custom flows.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### validate

This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.

#### Example

```ts
import { addShippingMethodToCartWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

addShippingMethodToCartWorkflow.hooks.validate(
  (async ({ input, cart }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.
