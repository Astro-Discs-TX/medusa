# cancelOrderFulfillmentWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `cancelOrderFulfillmentWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow cancels an order's fulfillment. It's used by the [Cancel Order's Fulfillment Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#orders\_postordersidfulfillmentsfulfillment\_idcancel).

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the canceled fulfillment. For example, you can pass under `additional_data` custom data that
allows you to update custom data models linked to the fulfillment.

You can also use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around canceling a fulfillment.
