# batchProductVariantsWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `batchProductVariantsWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow creates, updates, and deletes product variants. It's used by the 
[Manage Variants in a Product Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#products\_postproductsidvariantsbatch).

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows to manage the variants of a product. You can also
use this within a [seed script](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/custom-cli-scripts/seed-data) or in a custom import script.
