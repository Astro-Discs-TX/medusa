- `jobs`: Holds your [scheduled jobs](../scheduled-jobs/page.mdx) that run at a specified interval during your Medusa application's runtime.
- `links`: Holds you [module links](../../advanced-development/module-links/page.mdx) that build associations between data models of different modules.
- `modules`: Holds your custom [modules](../modules/page.mdx) that implement custom business logic.
- `scripts`: Holds your custom [scripts](../../advanced-development/custom-cli-scripts/page.mdx) to be executed using Medusa's CLI tool.
