In this chapter, you’ll learn about configuring the relationship cascades of a data model.

## What is a Relationship Cascade?

When an operation is performed on a data model, such as record deletion, the relationship cascade specifies what related data model records should also be deleted.

For example, if a store is deleted, its products should also be deleted.

## Configure Relationship Cascades

The `cascades` method used on a data model configures which child records an operation is cascaded to.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["8", "", "When a store is deleted, delete its associated products."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
import { model } from "@medusajs/utils"

const Store = model.define("store", {
  id: model.id(),
  products: model.hasMany(() => Product),
})
.cascades({
  delete: ["products"],
})

const Product = model.define("product", {
  id: model.id(),
  store: model.belongsTo(() => Store, {
    mappedBy: "products",
  }),
})
```

The `cascades` method accepts an object. Its key is the operation’s name, such as `delete`. The value is an array of relationship property names that the operation is cascaded to.

In the example above, when a store is deleted, its associated products are also deleted.
