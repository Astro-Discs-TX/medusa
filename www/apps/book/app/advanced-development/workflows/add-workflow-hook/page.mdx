In this chapter, you'll learn what a workflow hook is, how to expose it in your workflow, and how to consume the hook with a handler.

## What is a Workflow Hook?

A workflow hook is a point in a workflow where you can inject custom functionality as a step function, called a hook handler.

Hook handlers receive input from the workflow to perform custom actions during the workflow's execution.

<Note title="Use workflow hooks when" type="success">

- Your workflow is reusable in other applications, and you allow performing an external action at some point in your workflow.

</Note>

<Note title="Don't use workflow hooks if" type="error">

- Your workflow isn't reusable by other applications. Use a step that performs what a hook handler would instead.

## How to Expose a Hook in a Workflow?

To expose a hook in your workflow, use the `createHook` function imported from `@medusajs/workflows-sdk`.

For example:

export const hookHighlights = [
  ["13", "createHook", "Add a hook to the workflow."],
  ["14", `"productCreated"`, "The hook's name."],
  ["15", "productId", "The data to pass to the hook handler."],
  ["19", "hooks", "Return the list of hooks in the workflow."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/my-workflow/index.ts" highlights={hookHighlights}
import {
  createStep,
  createHook,
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
import { createProductStep } from "./steps/create-product"

export const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "my-workflow", 
  function (input) {
    const product = createProductStep(input)
    const productCreatedHook = createHook(
      "productCreated", 
      { productId: product.id }
    )

    return new WorkflowResponse(product, {
      hooks: [productCreatedHook],
    })
  }
)
```

The `createHook` function accepts two parameters:

1. The first is a string indicating the hook's name. This is used to add a hook handler later.
2. The second is the input to pass to the hook handler.

The workflow must also pass an object having a `hooks` property as a second parameter to the `WorkflowResponse` constructor. Its value is an array of the workflow's hooks.

## How to Consume a Hook?

You consume a hook by registering a hook handler on the workflow. A hook handler is registered in a TypeScript or JavaScript file created in the `src/workflows/hooks` directory.

You'll find a workflow's exposed hooks in its `hooks` property.

For example, to consume the hook of the workflow in the previous example, create the file `src/workflows/hooks/my-workflow.ts` with the following content:

export const handlerHighlights = [
  ["3", "productCreated", "Invoke the hook, passing it a step function as a parameter."],
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/my-workflow.ts" highlights={handlerHighlights}
import { myWorkflow } from "../my-workflow"

myWorkflow.hooks.productCreated(
  async ({ productId }, { container }) => {
    // TODO perform an action
  }
)
```

<Note>

A hook can have only one handler.

</Note>

The hook is available on the workflow's `hooks` property using its name `productCreated`. You invoke the hook, passing the handler as a parameter, which is a step function.

Similar to a step, the handler receives the hook's input as a first parameter, and the container in the object as a second parameter.

### Hook Handler Compensation

You can also pass a compensation function as a second parameter:

```ts
import { myWorkflow } from "../my-workflow"

myWorkflow.hooks.productCreated(
  async ({ productId }, { container }) => {
    // TODO perform an action
  },
  async () => {
    // undo the performed action
  }
)
```

The compensation function is executed if an error occurs in the workflow to undo the actions performed by the hook handler.
