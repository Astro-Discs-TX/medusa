In this chapter, you'll learn what a workflow hook is, and an example of how to consume a workflow hook defined in Medusa.

## What is a Workflow Hook?

A workflow hook is a point in a workflow where you can inject custom functionality as a step function, called a hook handler.

Hook handlers receive input from the workflow to perform custom actions during the workflow's execution.

<Note title="Use workflow hooks when" type="success">

- Your workflow is reusable in other applications, and you allow performing an external action at some point in your workflow.

</Note>

<Note title="Don't use workflow hooks if" type="error">

- Your workflow isn't reusable by other applications. Use a step that performs what a hook handler would instead.

</Note>

## How to Consume a Hook?

You consume a hook by registering a hook handler on the workflow. A hook handler is registered in a TypeScript or JavaScript file created in the `src/workflows/hooks` directory.

You'll find a workflow's exposed hooks in its `hooks` property.

For example, to consume the `productsCreated` hook of the `createProductsWorkflow`, which Medusa uses when a product is created using the admin API routes, create the file `src/workflows/hooks/my-workflow.ts` with the following content:

export const handlerHighlights = [
  ["3", "productCreated", "Invoke the hook, passing it a step function as a parameter."],
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/my-workflow.ts" highlights={handlerHighlights}
import { myWorkflow } from "../my-workflow"

myWorkflow.hooks.productCreated(
  async ({ productId }, { container }) => {
    // TODO perform an action
  }
)
```

<Note>

A hook can have only one handler.

</Note>

The hook is available on the workflow's `hooks` property using its name `productCreated`. You invoke the hook, passing the handler as a parameter, which is a step function.

Similar to a step, the handler receives the hook's input as a first parameter, and the container in the object as a second parameter.

### Hook Handler Compensation

You can also pass a compensation function as a second parameter:

```ts
import { myWorkflow } from "../my-workflow"

myWorkflow.hooks.productCreated(
  async ({ productId }, { container }) => {
    // TODO perform an action
  },
  async () => {
    // undo the performed action
  }
)
```

The compensation function is executed if an error occurs in the workflow to undo the actions performed by the hook handler.
