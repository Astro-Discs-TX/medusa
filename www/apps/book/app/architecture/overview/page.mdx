In this chapter, you'll learn about the architectural layers in Medusa.

## API Layer

Medusa's server is headless. So, clients, such as storefronts or admin dashboards, send HTTP requests to Medusa's API routes to provide commerce features.

The API routes use the Medusa framework's tools to perform functionalities implemented in Medusa's commerce modules.

The framework tools include workflows, module links, Query, architectural modules, and more orchestration tools under-the-hood.

## Database Layer

The Medusa application injects into each module a connection to the configured PostgreSQL database.

Modules use that connection to read and write data to the database.

## Service Layer

Third-party services are integrated through commerce and architectural modules.

You also create custom third-party integrations through a custom module.

### Commerce Modules

Commerce modules integrate third-party services relevant for commerce or user-facing features. For example, you integrate Stripe through a payment module provider.

These integrations are used when an HTTP request is sent, or as a result of a scheduled action or an emitted event.

### Architectural Modules

Architectural modules integrate third-party services and systems for architectural features. For example, you integrate Redis as a pub/sub service to send events, or SendGrid to send notifications.
