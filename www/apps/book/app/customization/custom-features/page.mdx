In this chapter, you'll learn about the concepts you need to build custom features in your Medusa application.

## Custom Development Resources

Your custom development consists mainly of three resources:

1. A module's service that provides methods to interact with the database or integrate third-party services.
2. A workflow that implements the steps of a custom feature, such as creating a product, using the service's methods. It also implements roll-back features in case of an error.
3. An API route that exposes the workflow's functionality to clients such as the storefront or admin dashbaord.

The next chapters provide step-by-step guides on how to add brands to the Medusa application using a module, workflow, and API route.
