In this chapter, you'll learn how to manage links between records of linked data models using the remote link.

## What is the Remote Link?

The remote link is a class with utility methods to manage links between data models. It’s registered in the Medusa container under the `remoteLink` registration name.

For example:

```ts collapsibleLines="1-9" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import { 
  MedusaRequest, 
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { 
  ContainerRegistrationKeys,
} from "@medusajs/utils"
import { 
  RemoteLink,
} from "@medusajs/modules-sdk"

export async function POST(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
): Promise<void> {
  const remoteLink: RemoteLink = req.scope.resolve(
    ContainerRegistrationKeys.REMOTE_LINK
  )
    
  // ...
}
```

You can use its methods to manage links, such as create or delete links.

## Create Link

To create a link between records of two data models, use the `create` method of the remote link.

For example:

```ts
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/utils"

// ...

await remoteLink.create({
  [Modules.PRODUCT]: {
    product_id: "prod_123",
  },
  "brandModuleService": {
    brand_id: "123",
  },
})
```

The `create` method accepts as a parameter an object. The object’s keys are the names of the linked modules.

<Note title="Important">

The keys (names of linked modules) must be in the same direction of the link definition.

</Note>

The value of each module’s property is an object, whose keys are of the format `{data_model_snake_name}_id`, and values are the IDs of the linked record.

So, in the example above, you link a record of the `Brand` data model in the Brand Module to a `Product` record in the Product Module.

---

## Dismiss Link

To remove a link between records of two data models, use the `dismiss` method of the remote link.

For example:

```ts
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/utils"

// ...

await remoteLink.dismiss({
  [Modules.PRODUCT]: {
    product_id: "prod_123",
  },
  "brandModuleService": {
    brand_id: "123",
  },
})
```

The `dismiss` method accepts the same parameter type as the [create method](#create-link).

<Note title="Important">

The keys (names of linked modules) must be in the same direction of the link definition.

</Note>

---

## Cascade Delete Linked Records

If a record is deleted, use the `delete` method of the remote link to delete all linked records.

For example:

```ts
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/utils"

// ...

await productModuleService.deleteProducts(["prod_123"])

await remoteLink.delete({
  [Modules.PRODUCT]: {
    product_id: "prod_123",
  },
})
```

This deletes all records linked to the deleted product.

---

## Restore Linked Records

If a record that was previously soft-deleted is now restored, use the `restore` method of the remote link to restore all linked records.

For example:

```ts
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/utils"

// ...

await productModuleService.restoreProducts(["prod_123"])

await remoteLink.restore({
  [Modules.PRODUCT]: {
    product_id: "prod_123",
  },
})
```

## Next: Query Data Between Linked Records

After you've linked records, you want to retrieve them in other resources.

For example, you want to retrieve brands with their products.

The next chapter explains how to do that using the remote query.
