In this chapter, you'll learn how to retrieve data across linked records using the remote query.

## What is the Remote Query?

The remote query is a function that retrieves data across modules and their links. It’s registered in the Medusa container under the `remoteQuery` registration name.

For example, create the API route `src/api/store/query/route.ts` with the following content:

export const exampleHighlights = [
  ["18", "", "Resolve the remote query from the Medusa container."],
  ["21", "remoteQueryObjectFromString", "Utility function to build the query."],
  ["22", "entryPoint", "The name of the data model you're querying."],
  ["23", "fields", "An array of the data model’s properties to retrieve in the result."],
  ["27", "remoteQuery", "Run the query using the remote query."]
]

```ts title="src/api/store/query/route.ts" highlights={exampleHighlights} apiTesting testApiMethod="GET" testApiUrl="http://localhost:9000/store/query" collapsibleLines="1-12" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import { 
  MedusaRequest, 
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { 
  remoteQueryObjectFromString,
  ContainerRegistrationKeys,
} from "@medusajs/utils"
import type { 
  RemoteQueryFunction,
} from "@medusajs/modules-sdk"

export async function GET(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
): Promise<void> {
  const remoteQuery: RemoteQueryFunction = req.scope.resolve(
    ContainerRegistrationKeys.REMOTE_QUERY
  )

  const query = remoteQueryObjectFromString({
    entryPoint: "brand",
    fields: ["id", "name"],
  })

  res.json({
    brands: await remoteQuery(query),
  })
}
```

In the above example, you resolve `remoteQuery` from the Medusa container.

Then, you create a query using the `remoteQueryObjectFromString` utility function imported from `@medusajs/utils`. This function accepts as a parameter an object with the following required properties:

- `entryPoint`: The data model's name, as specified in the first parameter of the `model.define` method used for the data model's definition.
- `fields`: An array of the data model’s properties to retrieve in the result.

You then pass the query to the `remoteQuery` function to retrieve the list of brands.

## Retrieve Linked Records

Retrieve the records of a linked data model by passing in `fields` the data model's name suffixed with `.*`.

For example, to retrieve the products of a brand:

<CodeTabs group="query-link-type">
  <CodeTab value="list" label="List Links">

```ts highlights={[["6"]]}
const query = remoteQueryObjectFromString({
  entryPoint: "brand",
  fields: [
    "id", 
    "name",
    "products.*",
  ],
})
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab value="default" label="Default Links">

```ts highlights={[["6"]]}
const query = remoteQueryObjectFromString({
  entryPoint: "brand",
  fields: [
    "id", 
    "name",
    "product.*",
  ],
})
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

For list links, pass the plural name of the linked data model suffixed with `.*`.

Otherwise, for default links, pass the data model's name suffixed with `.*`.

<Note title="Tip">

`.*` means that all of data model's properties should be retrieved. To retrieve a specific property, replace the `*` with the property's name. For example, `product.title`.

</Note>

## Apply Filters

```ts highlights={[["6"], ["7"], ["8"], ["9"]]}
const query = remoteQueryObjectFromString({
  entryPoint: "brand",
  fields: ["id", "name"],
  variables: {
    filters: {
      id: [
        "01HWSVWR4D2XVPQ06DQ8X9K7AX",
        "01HWSVWK3KYHKQEE6QGS2JC3FX",
      ],
    },
  },
})

const result = await remoteQuery(query)
```

The `remoteQueryObjectFromString` function accepts a `variables` property. You can use this property to filter retrieved records.

<TypeList
  types={[
    {
      name: "variables",
      type: "`object`",
      description: "Variables to pass to the query.",
      children: [
        {
          name: "filters",
          type: "`object`",
          description: "The filters to apply on any of the data model's properties."
        }
      ]
    },
  ]}
  sectionTitle="Apply Filters"
/>

## Sort Records

```ts highlights={[["5"], ["6"], ["7"]]}
const query = remoteQueryObjectFromString({
  entryPoint: "brand",
  fields: ["id", "name"],
  variables: {
    order: {
      name: "DESC",
    },
  },
})

const result = await remoteQuery(query)
```

To sort returned records, pass an `order` property to `variables`.

The `order` property is an object whose keys are property names, and values are either:

- `ASC` to sort records by that property in ascending order.
- `DESC` to sort records by that property in descending order.

---

## Apply Pagination

```ts highlights={[["5", "skip", "The number of records to skip before fetching the results."], ["6", "take", "The number of records to fetch."]]}
const query = remoteQueryObjectFromString({
  entryPoint: "brand",
  fields: ["id", "name"],
  variables: {
    skip: 0,
    take: 10,
  },
})

const { 
  rows, 
  metadata: { count, take, skip },
} = await remoteQuery(query)
```

To paginate the returned records, pass the following properties to `variables`:

- `skip`: (required to apply pagination) The number of records to skip before fetching the results.
- `take`: The number of records to fetch.

When the pagination fields are provided, the `remoteQuery` returns an object having two properties:

<TypeList types={[
  {
    name: "rows",
    type: "`array`",
    description: "The returned records."
  },
  {
    name: "metadata",
    type: "`object`",
    description: "The pagination details",
    children: [
      {
        name: "skip",
        type: "`number`",
        description: "The number of records skipped."
      },
      {
        name: "take",
        type: "`number`",
        description: "The number of records requested to fetch."
      },
      {
        name: "count",
        type: "`number`",
        description: "The total number of records."
      }
    ]
  }
]} sectionTitle="Apply Pagination" />

## Next: Pass Data For Linked Models in Routes

After linking the `brand` and `product` data models, you want to utilize the Create Product API route so that, when a brand is supplied in the request body, it links the brand to the product.

The next chapter explains how to extend existing API routes with additional data and functionalities.
