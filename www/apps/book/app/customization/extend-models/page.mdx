In this chapter, you'll learn about Medusa's approach to extending data models.

## Extend Models Use Case

In many use cases, you may need to extend existing data models for your custom development.

For example, after you added brands in your Medusa application in the previous chapters, you want to associate products with those brands.

However, the `product` and `brand` data models are created in different modules. So, how do you extend the `product` model to associate it with a brand?

## Modules Isolation

A module is unaware of any resources other than its own, such as services or data models. This means it can't access these resources if they're implemented in another module.

For example, your custom module can't resolve the Product Module's main service or have direct relationships from its data model to the Product Module's data models.

### Why are Modules Isolated?

Through module isolation, you can:

- Integrate your module into any Medusa application without side-effects to your setup.
- Replace existing modules with your custom implementation, if it's drastically different.
- Use modules in other environments, such as Edge functions and Next.js apps.

## Introducing Module Links

Medusa still provides the necessary tools and concepts that are similar to extending a data model while maintaining module isolation.

The main concept that replaces extending modules is creating a module link. A module link forms an association between two data models of different modules.

The next chapters explain how to define links between data models of different modules, how to retrieved the data of linked records, and more.
