In this chapter, you'll learn the different approaches to integrating a third-party system.

## Example Use Case: Syncing Brands

Consider that the Brand Module you created in previous chapters is actually connected to a third-party system, such as a Content-Management System (CMS).

In this use case scenario, you want to maintain two-way sync between the Medusa application's brands and the brands in the third-party system so that:

1. When you create a brand in Medusa, you also want to create the brand in the third-party system.
2. While the Medusa application is running, you want to sync the brands from the third-party system into Medusa.

## Integrate Third-Party Systems with Services

As mentioned previously, integrations to third-party systems are implemented in services. It can either be the main module's service, or an internal service in the module that's used by the main one.

Then, when you implement a feature that integrates the third-party system, you implement it in a workflow that uses the service. Steps' compensation functions, which roll-back changes when error occurs, ensure that there are no data inconsistency between your Medusa application and the third-party system.

Finally, you can use the workflow in other resources, such as a subscriber to handle events, or a scheduled job to perform an action at specified time interval.

## Next: Syncing Brands Example

The next chapters give examples of how to implement the features in the use case mentioned previously to sync brands with a third-party system.
