___

### defaultMaxListeners

 `Static` **defaultMaxListeners**: `number`

By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single
event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances
using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default
for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown.

Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the
change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before
the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has
precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`.

This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow
more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating
that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to
temporarily avoid this warning:

```js
import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1);
emitter.once('event', () => {
  // do stuff
  emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0));
});
```

The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the
stack trace for such warnings.

The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will
have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to
the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached
listeners, respectively.
Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.

___

### errorMonitor

 `Static` `Readonly` **errorMonitor**: typeof [`errorMonitor`](Socket.md#errormonitor)

This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called.

Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no
regular `'error'` listener is installed.

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.
	-`listConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional)

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.

	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.

		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.

		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.

		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`:

	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional)

	-`method`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** The request method as a string. Read only. Examples: `'GET'`, `'DELETE'`.
	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown.

Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

#### Returns

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.
		-`destination`: `DiskStorage` only: Directory to which this file has been uploaded.
		-`encoding`: Value of the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header for this file.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`:

	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.

	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.

		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.

	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`:

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.

		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

		-`stream`: A readable stream of this file. Only available to the `_handleFile` callback for custom `StorageEngine`s.
	-`files`: (optional) Array or dictionary of `Multer.File` object populated by `array()`, `fields()`, and `any()` middleware.
	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional)

	-`method`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** The request method as a string. Read only. Examples: `'GET'`, `'DELETE'`.
	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.

		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.

	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.

		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.

		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.

This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly.

	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`:

	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.

		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

### addTrailers

**addTrailers**(`headers`): `void`

Adds HTTP trailers (headers but at the end of the message) to the message.

Trailers will **only** be emitted if the message is chunked encoded. If not,
the trailers will be silently discarded.

HTTP requires the `Trailer` header to be sent to emit trailers,
with a list of header field names in its value, e.g.

```js
message.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
                         'Trailer': 'Content-MD5' });
message.write(fileData);
message.addTrailers({ 'Content-MD5': '7895bf4b8828b55ceaf47747b4bca667' });
message.end();
```

Attempting to set a header field name or value that contains invalid characters
will result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

#### Parameters

| Name |
| :------ |
| `headers` | [`OutgoingHttpHeaders`](../interfaces/OutgoingHttpHeaders.md) \| readonly [`string`, `string`][] |

#### Returns

`void`

-`void`: (optional)

### appendHeader

**appendHeader**(`name`, `value`): [`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

Append a single header value for the header object.

If the value is an array, this is equivalent of calling this method multiple
times.

If there were no previous value for the header, this is equivalent of calling `outgoingMessage.setHeader(name, value)`.

Depending of the value of `options.uniqueHeaders` when the client request or the
server were created, this will end up in the header being sent multiple times or
a single time with values joined using `; `.

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| `name` | `string` | Header name |
| `value` | `string` \| readonly `string`[] | Header value |

#### Returns

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.

	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

### cork

**cork**(): `void`

The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory.
The buffered data will be flushed when either the [uncork](../interfaces/Response.md#uncork) or [end](../interfaces/Response.md#end) methods are called.

The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which
several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of
immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()`buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them
all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking
situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk
to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing`writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.

### destroy

**destroy**(`error?`): [`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

Destroy the stream. Optionally emit an `'error'` event, and emit a `'close'`event (unless `emitClose` is set to `false`). After this call, the writable
stream has ended and subsequent calls to `write()` or `end()` will result in
an `ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED` error.
This is a destructive and immediate way to destroy a stream. Previous calls to`write()` may not have drained, and may trigger an `ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED` error.
Use `end()` instead of destroy if data should flush before close, or wait for
the `'drain'` event before destroying the stream.

Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no
further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

Implementors should not override this method,
but instead implement `writable._destroy()`.

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| `error?` | `Error` | Optional, an error to emit with `'error'` event. |

#### Returns

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.

		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.

	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.

		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.

		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.

		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.

		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');

		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`:

		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.

		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.

		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown.

Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

### emit

**emit**(`event`): `boolean`

Synchronously calls each of the listeners registered for the event named`eventName`, in the order they were registered, passing the supplied arguments
to each.

Returns `true` if the event had listeners, `false` otherwise.

```js
import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// First listener
myEmitter.on('event', function firstListener() {
  console.log('Helloooo! first listener');
});
// Second listener
myEmitter.on('event', function secondListener(arg1, arg2) {
  console.log(`event with parameters ${arg1}, ${arg2} in second listener`);
});
// Third listener
myEmitter.on('event', function thirdListener(...args) {
  const parameters = args.join(', ');
  console.log(`event with parameters ${parameters} in third listener`);
});

console.log(myEmitter.listeners('event'));

myEmitter.emit('event', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// Prints:
// [
//   [Function: firstListener],
//   [Function: secondListener],
//   [Function: thirdListener]
// ]
// Helloooo! first listener
// event with parameters 1, 2 in second listener

### end

**end**(`cb?`): [`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

Calling the `writable.end()` method signals that no more data will be written
to the `Writable`. The optional `chunk` and `encoding` arguments allow one
final additional chunk of data to be written immediately before closing the
stream.

Calling the [write](../interfaces/Response.md#write) method after calling [end](../interfaces/Response.md#end) will raise an error.

```js
// Write 'hello, ' and then end with 'world!'.
const fs = require('node:fs');
const file = fs.createWriteStream('example.txt');
file.write('hello, ');
file.end('world!');
// Writing more now is not allowed!
```

#### Parameters

| Name |
| :------ |
| `cb?` | () => `void` |

#### Returns

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.
		-`destination`: `DiskStorage` only: Directory to which this file has been uploaded.
		-`encoding`: Value of the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header for this file.
		-`fieldname`: Name of the form field associated with this file.
		-`filename`: `DiskStorage` only: Name of this file within `destination`.
		-`mimetype`: Value of the `Content-Type` header for this file.
		-`originalname`: Name of the file on the uploader's computer.
		-`path`: `DiskStorage` only: Full path to the uploaded file.
		-`size`: Size of the file in bytes.
		-`stream`: A readable stream of this file. Only available to the `_handleFile` callback for custom `StorageEngine`s.
	-`files`: (optional) Array or dictionary of `Multer.File` object populated by `array()`, `fields()`, and `any()` middleware.
	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`method`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** The request method as a string. Read only. Examples: `'GET'`, `'DELETE'`.
	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.

	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.

		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.

	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.

It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.

	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.

	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

listeners. The values in the array are strings or `Symbol`s.

```js
import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';

const myEE = new EventEmitter();
myEE.on('foo', () => {});
myEE.on('bar', () => {});

const sym = Symbol('symbol');
myEE.on(sym, () => {});

console.log(myEE.eventNames());
// Prints: [ 'foo', 'bar', Symbol(symbol) ]
```

### flushHeaders

**flushHeaders**(): `void`

Flushes the message headers.

For efficiency reason, Node.js normally buffers the message headers
until `outgoingMessage.end()` is called or the first chunk of message data
is written. It then tries to pack the headers and data into a single TCP
packet.

It is usually desired (it saves a TCP round-trip), but not when the first
data is not sent until possibly much later. `outgoingMessage.flushHeaders()`bypasses the optimization and kickstarts the message.

#### Returns

`void`

### getHeader

**getHeader**(`name`): `undefined` \| `string` \| `number` \| `string`[]

Gets the value of the HTTP header with the given name. If that header is not
set, the returned value will be `undefined`.

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |

### getHeaders

**getHeaders**(): [`OutgoingHttpHeaders`](../interfaces/OutgoingHttpHeaders.md)

Returns a shallow copy of the current outgoing headers. Since a shallow
copy is used, array values may be mutated without additional calls to
various header-related HTTP module methods. The keys of the returned
object are the header names and the values are the respective header
values. All header names are lowercase.

The object returned by the `outgoingMessage.getHeaders()` method does
not prototypically inherit from the JavaScript `Object`. This means that
typical `Object` methods such as `obj.toString()`, `obj.hasOwnProperty()`,
and others are not defined and will not work.

```js
outgoingMessage.setHeader('Foo', 'bar');
outgoingMessage.setHeader('Set-Cookie', ['foo=bar', 'bar=baz']);

const headers = outgoingMessage.getHeaders();
// headers === { foo: 'bar', 'set-cookie': ['foo=bar', 'bar=baz'] }
```

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.
		-`destination`: `DiskStorage` only: Directory to which this file has been uploaded.
		-`encoding`: Value of the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header for this file.
		-`fieldname`: Name of the form field associated with this file.
		-`filename`: `DiskStorage` only: Name of this file within `destination`.
		-`mimetype`: Value of the `Content-Type` header for this file.
		-`originalname`: Name of the file on the uploader's computer.
		-`path`: `DiskStorage` only: Full path to the uploaded file.
		-`size`: Size of the file in bytes.
		-`stream`: A readable stream of this file. Only available to the `_handleFile` callback for custom `StorageEngine`s.
	-`files`: (optional) Array or dictionary of `Multer.File` object populated by `array()`, `fields()`, and `any()` middleware.
	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`:

	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.

		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```
	-`user`: (optional) 
	-`validatedBody`: 
	-`validatedQuery`: 
		-`expand`: (optional) {@inheritDoc FindParams.expand}
		-`fields`: (optional) {@inheritDoc FindParams.fields}
		-`limit`: (optional) {@inheritDoc FindPaginationParams.limit}
		-`offset`: (optional) {@inheritDoc FindPaginationParams.offset}
		-`order`: (optional) The field to sort the data by. By default, the sort order is ascending. To change the order to descending, prefix the field name with `-`.

___

### on

**on**(`event`, `listener`): [`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

Adds the `listener` function to the end of the listeners array for the
event named `eventName`. No checks are made to see if the `listener` has
already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of `eventName`and `listener` will result in the `listener` being added, and called, multiple
times.

```js
server.on('connection', (stream) => {
  console.log('someone connected!');
});
```

Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The`emitter.prependListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the
event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

```js
import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
const myEE = new EventEmitter();
myEE.on('foo', () => console.log('a'));
myEE.prependListener('foo', () => console.log('b'));
myEE.emit('foo');
// Prints:
//   b
//   a
```

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| `event` | ``"close"`` | The name of the event. |
| `listener` | () => `void` | The callback function |

This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.

	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.

To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.
		-`destination`: `DiskStorage` only: Directory to which this file has been uploaded.
		-`encoding`: Value of the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header for this file.
		-`fieldname`: Name of the form field associated with this file.
		-`filename`: `DiskStorage` only: Name of this file within `destination`.
		-`mimetype`: Value of the `Content-Type` header for this file.
		-`originalname`: Name of the file on the uploader's computer.
		-`path`: `DiskStorage` only: Full path to the uploaded file.

		-`stream`: A readable stream of this file. Only available to the `_handleFile` callback for custom `StorageEngine`s.
	-`files`: (optional) Array or dictionary of `Multer.File` object populated by `array()`, `fields()`, and `any()` middleware.
	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.

	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed.

	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional)

	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.

	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.

		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.

	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.

		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.

		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.

		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`:

	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional)

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown.

Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`:

		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`:

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.

		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.

		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.

		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.

		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

### once

**once**(`event`, `listener`): [`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

Adds a **one-time**`listener` function for the event named `eventName`. The
next time `eventName` is triggered, this listener is removed and then invoked.

```js
server.once('connection', (stream) => {
  console.log('Ah, we have our first user!');
});
```

Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The`emitter.prependOnceListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the
event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

```js
import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
const myEE = new EventEmitter();
myEE.once('foo', () => console.log('a'));
myEE.prependOnceListener('foo', () => console.log('b'));
myEE.emit('foo');
// Prints:
//   b
//   a
```

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| `event` | ``"close"`` | The name of the event. |
| `listener` | () => `void` | The callback function |

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional)

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.

	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.

		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.

Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.
		-`destination`: `DiskStorage` only: Directory to which this file has been uploaded.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`:

	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.

	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed.

	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.

It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional)

	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.

		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.

		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.

		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.

		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).

		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`:

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.

	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.

	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.
		-`destination`: `DiskStorage` only: Directory to which this file has been uploaded.
		-`encoding`: Value of the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header for this file.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`:

	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

### prependListener

**prependListener**(`event`, `listener`): [`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

Adds the `listener` function to the _beginning_ of the listeners array for the
event named `eventName`. No checks are made to see if the `listener` has
already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of `eventName`and `listener` will result in the `listener` being added, and called, multiple
times.

```js
server.prependListener('connection', (stream) => {
  console.log('someone connected!');
});
```

Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| `event` | ``"close"`` | The name of the event. |
| `listener` | () => `void` | The callback function |

#### Returns

		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.

Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`method`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** The request method as a string. Read only. Examples: `'GET'`, `'DELETE'`.
	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.

		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.

	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.

		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.

	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.

It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.

	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`.

	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`:

	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.

		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.

Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.

		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.

	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.

		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.

		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).

		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.

This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected.

The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional)

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.

	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.

		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`:

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`:

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.

		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.
		-`destination`: `DiskStorage` only: Directory to which this file has been uploaded.
		-`encoding`: Value of the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header for this file.
		-`fieldname`: Name of the form field associated with this file.

		-`originalname`: Name of the file on the uploader's computer.
		-`path`: `DiskStorage` only: Full path to the uploaded file.

	-`files`: (optional) Array or dictionary of `Multer.File` object populated by `array()`, `fields()`, and `any()` middleware.
	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

### prependOnceListener

**prependOnceListener**(`event`, `listener`): [`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

Adds a **one-time**`listener` function for the event named `eventName` to the _beginning_ of the listeners array. The next time `eventName` is triggered, this
listener is removed, and then invoked.

```js
server.prependOnceListener('connection', (stream) => {
  console.log('Ah, we have our first user!');
});
```

Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| `event` | ``"close"`` | The name of the event. |
| `listener` | () => `void` | The callback function |

#### Returns

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.
	-`listConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`method`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** The request method as a string. Read only. Examples: `'GET'`, `'DELETE'`.
	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.

	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.

		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.

		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.

		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.

		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional)

		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown.

Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`:

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.

		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.

Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`:

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.

		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.

		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow.

The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.

For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.
		-`destination`: `DiskStorage` only: Directory to which this file has been uploaded.
		-`encoding`: Value of the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header for this file.
		-`fieldname`: Name of the form field associated with this file.
		-`filename`: `DiskStorage` only: Name of this file within `destination`.
		-`mimetype`: Value of the `Content-Type` header for this file.
		-`originalname`: Name of the file on the uploader's computer.
		-`path`: `DiskStorage` only: Full path to the uploaded file.
		-`size`: Size of the file in bytes.
		-`stream`: A readable stream of this file. Only available to the `_handleFile` callback for custom `StorageEngine`s.
	-`files`: (optional) Array or dictionary of `Multer.File` object populated by `array()`, `fields()`, and `any()` middleware.
	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.

	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.

		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

### rawListeners

**rawListeners**(`eventName`): `Function`[]

Returns a copy of the array of listeners for the event named `eventName`,
including any wrappers (such as those created by `.once()`).

```js
import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
emitter.once('log', () => console.log('log once'));

// Returns a new Array with a function `onceWrapper` which has a property
// `listener` which contains the original listener bound above
const listeners = emitter.rawListeners('log');
const logFnWrapper = listeners[0];

// Logs "log once" to the console and does not unbind the `once` event
logFnWrapper.listener();

// Logs "log once" to the console and removes the listener
logFnWrapper();

emitter.on('log', () => console.log('log persistently'));
// Will return a new Array with a single function bound by `.on()` above
const newListeners = emitter.rawListeners('log');

// Logs "log persistently" twice
newListeners[0]();
emitter.emit('log');
```

#### Parameters

### removeAllListeners

**removeAllListeners**(`event?`): [`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code,
particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other
component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

#### Parameters

| Name |

	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.
	-`listConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`method`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** The request method as a string. Read only. Examples: `'GET'`, `'DELETE'`.
	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

### removeListener

**removeListener**(`event`, `listener`): [`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named`eventName`.

```js
const callback = (stream) => {
  console.log('someone connected!');
};
server.on('connection', callback);
// ...
server.removeListener('connection', callback);
```

`removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the
listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the
listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be
called multiple times to remove each instance.

Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the
time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any`removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls _after_ emitting and _before_ the last listener finishes execution
will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

```js
import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

const callbackA = () => {
  console.log('A');
  myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
};

const callbackB = () => {
  console.log('B');
};

myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

// callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
// Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
myEmitter.emit('event');
// Prints:
//   A
//   B

// callbackB is now removed.
// Internal listener array [callbackA]
myEmitter.emit('event');
// Prints:
//   A
```

Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will
change the position indices of any listener registered _after_ the listener
being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called,
but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by
the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single
event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most
recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')`listener is removed:

```js
import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
const ee = new EventEmitter();

function pong() {
  console.log('pong');
}

ee.on('ping', pong);
ee.once('ping', pong);
ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

ee.emit('ping');
ee.emit('ping');
```

Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

#### Parameters

| Name |
| :------ |
| `event` | ``"close"`` |
| `listener` | () => `void` |

	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.

	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`:

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```

		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.

		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.
		-`destination`: `DiskStorage` only: Directory to which this file has been uploaded.
		-`encoding`: Value of the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header for this file.
		-`fieldname`: Name of the form field associated with this file.
		-`filename`: `DiskStorage` only: Name of this file within `destination`.
		-`mimetype`: Value of the `Content-Type` header for this file.
		-`originalname`: Name of the file on the uploader's computer.
		-`path`: `DiskStorage` only: Full path to the uploaded file.
		-`size`: Size of the file in bytes.
		-`stream`: A readable stream of this file. Only available to the `_handleFile` callback for custom `StorageEngine`s.
	-`files`: (optional) Array or dictionary of `Multer.File` object populated by `array()`, `fields()`, and `any()` middleware.
	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.

	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`:

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.

		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.

It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional)

	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow.

		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.

		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.

		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`:

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

#### Returns

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`:

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.

This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

#### Returns

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.
		-`destination`: `DiskStorage` only: Directory to which this file has been uploaded.
		-`encoding`: Value of the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header for this file.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.
	-`listConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`method`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** The request method as a string. Read only. Examples: `'GET'`, `'DELETE'`.
	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
	-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
	-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
	-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
	-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.

		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.

	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.

		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.

		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.

		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.

		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`:

	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');

		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`:

		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.

		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown.

Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

### setHeader

**setHeader**(`name`, `value`): [`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

Sets a single header value. If the header already exists in the to-be-sent
headers, its value will be replaced. Use an array of strings to send multiple
headers with the same name.

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| `name` | `string` | Header name |
| `value` | `string` \| `number` \| readonly `string`[] | Header value |

#### Returns

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.
	-`accepted`: Return an array of Accepted media types ordered from highest quality to lowest.
		-`quality`: 
		-`subtype`: 
		-`type`: 
		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.
		-`checkout`: 
		-`connect`: 
		-`copy`: 
		-`delete`: 
		-`get`: 
		-`head`: 
		-`link`: 
		-`locals`: 
		-`lock`: 
		-`m-search`: 
		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`cookies`: 
	-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
	-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
	-`errors`: 
	-`file`: (optional) `Multer.File` object populated by `single()` middleware.
		-`buffer`: `MemoryStorage` only: A Buffer containing the entire file.
		-`destination`: `DiskStorage` only: Directory to which this file has been uploaded.
		-`encoding`: Value of the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header for this file.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.

		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.

		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.

The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

### setMaxListeners

**setMaxListeners**(`n`): [`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are
added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding
memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be
modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to`Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

#### Parameters

| Name |
| :------ |
| `n` | `number` |

#### Returns

[`OutgoingMessage`](OutgoingMessage.md)<`Request`\>

-`OutgoingMessage`: 
	-`aborted`: The `message.aborted` property will be `true` if the request has been aborted.

		-`value`: 
	-`allowedProperties`: 
	-`app`: 
		-`_router`: Used to get all registered routes in Express Application
		-`all`: Special-cased "all" method, applying the given route `path`, middleware, and callback to _every_ HTTP method.

		-`map`: 
		-`merge`: 
		-`mkactivity`: 
		-`mkcol`: 
		-`mountpath`: The app.mountpath property contains one or more path patterns on which a sub-app was mounted.
		-`move`: 
		-`notify`: 
		-`on`: The mount event is fired on a sub-app, when it is mounted on a parent app. The parent app is passed to the callback function. NOTE: Sub-apps will: - Not inherit the value of settings that have a default value. You must set the value in the sub-app. - Inherit the value of settings with no default value.
		-`options`: 
		-`patch`: 
		-`post`: 
		-`propfind`: 
		-`proppatch`: 
		-`purge`: 
		-`put`: 
		-`report`: 
		-`resource`: 
		-`router`: 
		-`routes`: The app.routes object houses all of the routes defined mapped by the associated HTTP verb. This object may be used for introspection capabilities, for example Express uses this internally not only for routing but to provide default OPTIONS behaviour unless app.options() is used. Your application or framework may also remove routes by simply by removing them from this object.
		-`search`: 
		-`settings`: 
		-`stack`: Stack of configured routes
		-`subscribe`: 
		-`trace`: 
		-`unlink`: 
		-`unlock`: 
		-`unsubscribe`: 
		-`use`: 
	-`baseUrl`: 
	-`body`: 
	-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
	-`complete`: The `message.complete` property will be `true` if a complete HTTP message has been received and successfully parsed. This property is particularly useful as a means of determining if a client or server fully transmitted a message before a connection was terminated: ```js const req = http.request({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080, method: 'POST', }, (res) => { res.resume(); res.on('end', () => { if (!res.complete) console.error( 'The connection was terminated while the message was still being sent'); }); }); ```
	-`connection`: Alias for `message.socket`.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.

		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.

		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).

This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown.

	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional)

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.

	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.

		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
		-`captureRejectionSymbol`: Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')` See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`trailersDistinct`: Similar to `message.trailers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow.

		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown. Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects _all_`EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`. This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single`EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()`methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning: ```js import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events'; const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1); emitter.once('event', () => { // do stuff emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0)); }); ``` The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings. The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
		-`errorMonitor`: This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular`'error'` listeners are called. Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

	-`filterableFields`: 
	-`fresh`: Check if the request is fresh, aka Last-Modified and/or the ETag still match.
	-`headers`: The request/response headers object. Key-value pairs of header names and values. Header names are lower-cased. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': 'curl/7.22.0', // host: '127.0.0.1:8000', // accept: '*' } console.log(request.headers); ``` Duplicates in raw headers are handled in the following ways, depending on the header name: * Duplicates of `age`, `authorization`, `content-length`, `content-type`,`etag`, `expires`, `from`, `host`, `if-modified-since`, `if-unmodified-since`,`last-modified`, `location`, `max-forwards`, `proxy-authorization`, `referer`,`retry-after`, `server`, or `user-agent` are discarded. To allow duplicate values of the headers listed above to be joined, use the option `joinDuplicateHeaders` in request and createServer. See RFC 9110 Section 5.3 for more information. * `set-cookie` is always an array. Duplicates are added to the array. * For duplicate `cookie` headers, the values are joined together with `; `. * For all other headers, the values are joined together with `, `.

	-`headersDistinct`: Similar to `message.headers`, but there is no join logic and the values are always arrays of strings, even for headers received just once. ```js // Prints something like: // // { 'user-agent': ['curl/7.22.0'], // host: ['127.0.0.1:8000'], // accept: ['*'] } console.log(request.headersDistinct); ```
	-`host`: 
	-`hostname`: Parse the "Host" header field hostname.
	-`httpVersion`: In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server. Probably either `'1.1'` or `'1.0'`. Also `message.httpVersionMajor` is the first integer and`message.httpVersionMinor` is the second.
	-`httpVersionMajor`: 
	-`httpVersionMinor`: 
	-`includes`: (optional) 
	-`ip`: Return the remote address, or when "trust proxy" is `true` return the upstream addr.
	-`ips`: When "trust proxy" is `true`, parse the "X-Forwarded-For" ip address list. For example if the value were "client, proxy1, proxy2" you would receive the array `["client", "proxy1", "proxy2"]` where "proxy2" is the furthest down-stream.

	-`next`: (optional) 
	-`originalUrl`: 
	-`params`: 
	-`path`: Short-hand for `url.parse(req.url).pathname`.
	-`protocol`: Return the protocol string "http" or "https" when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header field will be trusted. If you're running behind a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this may be enabled.
	-`query`: 
	-`rawHeaders`: The raw request/response headers list exactly as they were received. The keys and values are in the same list. It is _not_ a list of tuples. So, the even-numbered offsets are key values, and the odd-numbered offsets are the associated values. Header names are not lowercased, and duplicates are not merged. ```js // Prints something like: // // [ 'user-agent', // 'this is invalid because there can be only one', // 'User-Agent', // 'curl/7.22.0', // 'Host', // '127.0.0.1:8000', // 'ACCEPT', // '*' ] console.log(request.rawHeaders); ```
	-`rawTrailers`: The raw request/response trailer keys and values exactly as they were received. Only populated at the `'end'` event.
	-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
	-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
	-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
	-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.

	-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
	-`res`: (optional) After middleware.init executed, Request will contain res and next properties See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`app`: 
		-`charset`: 
		-`chunkedEncoding`: 
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connection`: Alias of `outgoingMessage.socket`.
		-`destroyed`: Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`finished`: 
		-`headersSent`: Read-only. `true` if the headers were sent, otherwise `false`.
		-`json`: Send JSON response. Examples: res.json(null); res.json({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).json('oh noes!'); res.status(404).json('I dont have that');
		-`jsonp`: Send JSON response with JSONP callback support. Examples: res.jsonp(null); res.jsonp({ user: 'tj' }); res.status(500).jsonp('oh noes!'); res.status(404).jsonp('I dont have that');
		-`locals`: 
		-`req`: After middleware.init executed, Response will contain req property See: express/lib/middleware/init.js
		-`send`: Send a response. Examples: res.send(new Buffer('wahoo')); res.send({ some: 'json' }); res.send('<p>some html</p>'); res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
		-`sendDate`: 
		-`shouldKeepAlive`: 
		-`socket`: Reference to the underlying socket. Usually, users will not want to access this property. After calling `outgoingMessage.end()`, this property will be nulled.
		-`statusCode`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. ```js response.statusCode = 404; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status code which was sent out.
		-`statusMessage`: When using implicit headers (not calling `response.writeHead()` explicitly), this property controls the status message that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed. If this is left as `undefined` then the standard message for the status code will be used. ```js response.statusMessage = 'Not found'; ``` After response header was sent to the client, this property indicates the status message which was sent out.
		-`strictContentLength`: If set to `true`, Node.js will check whether the `Content-Length`header value and the size of the body, in bytes, are equal. Mismatching the `Content-Length` header value will result in an `Error` being thrown, identified by `code:``'ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH'`.
		-`useChunkedEncodingByDefault`: 
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
		-`writableFinished`: Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
		-`writableHighWaterMark`: Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
		-`writableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`writableNeedDrain`: Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
		-`writableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
	-`retrieveConfig`: 
		-`order`: (optional) 
		-`relations`: (optional) 
		-`select`: (optional) 
		-`skip`: (optional) 
		-`take`: (optional) 
	-`route`: 
	-`scope`: 
		-`cache`: Resolved modules cache.
		-`cradle`: The proxy injected when using `PROXY` injection mode. Can be used as-is.
		-`options`: Options the container was configured with.
		-`registrations`: Getter for the rolled up registrations that merges the container family tree.
		-`createScope`: 
		-`registerAdd`: 
	-`secure`: Short-hand for: req.protocol == 'https'
	-`signedCookies`: 
	-`socket`: The `net.Socket` object associated with the connection. With HTTPS support, use `request.socket.getPeerCertificate()` to obtain the client's authentication details. This property is guaranteed to be an instance of the `net.Socket` class, a subclass of `stream.Duplex`, unless the user specified a socket type other than `net.Socket` or internally nulled.
		-`allowHalfOpen`: If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`. This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing`Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`autoSelectFamilyAttemptedAddresses`: This property is only present if the family autoselection algorithm is enabled in `socket.connect(options)` and it is an array of the addresses that have been attempted. Each address is a string in the form of `$IP:$PORT`. If the connection was successful, then the last address is the one that the socket is currently connected to.
		-`bufferSize`: This property shows the number of characters buffered for writing. The buffer may contain strings whose length after encoding is not yet known. So this number is only an approximation of the number of bytes in the buffer. `net.Socket` has the property that `socket.write()` always works. This is to help users get up and running quickly. The computer cannot always keep up with the amount of data that is written to a socket. The network connection simply might be too slow. Node.js will internally queue up the data written to a socket and send it out over the wire when it is possible. The consequence of this internal buffering is that memory may grow. Users who experience large or growing `bufferSize` should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with `socket.pause()` and `socket.resume()`.
		-`bytesRead`: The amount of received bytes.
		-`bytesWritten`: The amount of bytes sent.
		-`closed`: Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
		-`connecting`: If `true`,`socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` was called and has not yet finished. It will stay `true` until the socket becomes connected, then it is set to `false` and the `'connect'` event is emitted. Note that the `socket.connect(options[, connectListener])` callback is a listener for the `'connect'` event.
		-`destroyed`: See `writable.destroyed` for further details.
		-`errored`: Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
		-`localAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on. For example, in a server listening on `'0.0.0.0'`, if a client connects on `'192.168.1.1'`, the value of `socket.localAddress` would be`'192.168.1.1'`.
		-`localFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the local IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`.
		-`localPort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the local port. For example, `80` or `21`.
		-`pending`: This is `true` if the socket is not connected yet, either because `.connect()`has not yet been called or because it is still in the process of connecting (see `socket.connecting`).
		-`readable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `readable.read()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
		-`readableAborted`: Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
		-`readableDidRead`: Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
		-`readableEncoding`: Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding`property can be set using the `readable.setEncoding()` method.
		-`readableEnded`: Becomes `true` when `'end'` event is emitted.
		-`readableFlowing`: This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the `Three states` section.
		-`readableHighWaterMark`: Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
		-`readableLength`: This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
		-`readableObjectMode`: Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
		-`readyState`: This property represents the state of the connection as a string. * If the stream is connecting `socket.readyState` is `opening`. * If the stream is readable and writable, it is `open`. * If the stream is readable and not writable, it is `readOnly`. * If the stream is not readable and writable, it is `writeOnly`.
		-`remoteAddress`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,`'74.125.127.100'` or `'2001:4860:a005::68'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remoteFamily`: (optional) The string representation of the remote IP family. `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`remotePort`: (optional) The numeric representation of the remote port. For example, `80` or `21`. Value may be `undefined` if the socket is destroyed (for example, if the client disconnected).
		-`timeout`: (optional) The socket timeout in milliseconds as set by `socket.setTimeout()`. It is `undefined` if a timeout has not been set.
		-`writable`: Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
		-`writableCorked`: Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
		-`writableEnded`: Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.

		-`captureRejections`: Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
		-`defaultMaxListeners`: By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for _all_`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners`property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError`is thrown.

Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an`'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.
	-`stale`: Check if the request is stale, aka "Last-Modified" and / or the "ETag" for the resource has changed.
	-`statusCode`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. `404`.
	-`statusMessage`: (optional) **Only valid for response obtained from ClientRequest.** The HTTP response status message (reason phrase). E.G. `OK` or `Internal Server Error`.
	-`subdomains`: Return subdomains as an array. Subdomains are the dot-separated parts of the host before the main domain of the app. By default, the domain of the app is assumed to be the last two parts of the host. This can be changed by setting "subdomain offset". For example, if the domain is "tobi.ferrets.example.com": If "subdomain offset" is not set, req.subdomains is `["ferrets", "tobi"]`. If "subdomain offset" is 3, req.subdomains is `["tobi"]`.
	-`trailers`: The request/response trailers object. Only populated at the `'end'` event.

	-`url`: **Only valid for request obtained from [Server](Server.md).** Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request. Take the following request: ```http GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/plain ``` To parse the URL into its parts: ```js new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`); ``` When `request.url` is `'/status?name=ryan'` and `request.headers.host` is`'localhost:3000'`: ```console $ node > new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`) URL { href: 'http://localhost:3000/status?name=ryan', origin: 'http://localhost:3000', protocol: 'http:', username: '', password: '', host: 'localhost:3000', hostname: 'localhost', port: '3000', pathname: '/status', search: '?name=ryan', searchParams: URLSearchParams { 'name' => 'ryan' }, hash: '' } ```

### uncork

**uncork**(): `void`

The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since [cork](../interfaces/Response.md#cork) was called.

When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering
of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using`process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all`writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event
loop phase.

```js
stream.cork();
stream.write('some ');
stream.write('data ');
process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
```

If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the
same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered
data.

```js
stream.cork();
stream.write('some ');
stream.cork();
stream.write('data ');
process.nextTick(() => {
  stream.uncork();
  // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
  stream.uncork();
});
```

See also: `writable.cork()`.

#### Returns

### write

**write**(`chunk`, `callback?`): `boolean`

The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the
supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error
occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its
first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is
emitted.

The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the`highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`.
If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should
stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and
return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for
delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted.
Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks
until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that
is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until
maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally.
Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector
performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system,
even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never
drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is
not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly
problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused
by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler
is added.

If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is
recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use [pipe](../interfaces/Request.md#pipe). However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is
possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

```js
function write(data, cb) {
  if (!stream.write(data)) {
    stream.once('drain', cb);
  } else {
    process.nextTick(cb);
  }
}

// Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
write('hello', () => {
  console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
});
```

A `Writable` stream in object mode will always ignore the `encoding` argument.

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| `chunk` | `any` | Optional data to write. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a string, `Buffer` or `Uint8Array`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value other than `null`. |
| `callback?` | (`error`: `undefined` \| ``null`` \| `Error`) => `void` | Callback for when this chunk of data is flushed. |

#### Returns

`boolean`

-`boolean`: (optional) `false` if the stream wishes for the calling code to wait for the `'drain'` event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data; otherwise `true`.

### addAbortListener

`Static` **addAbortListener**(`signal`, `resource`): `Disposable`

Listens once to the `abort` event on the provided `signal`.

Listening to the `abort` event on abort signals is unsafe and may
lead to resource leaks since another third party with the signal can
call `e.stopImmediatePropagation()`. Unfortunately Node.js cannot change
this since it would violate the web standard. Additionally, the original
API makes it easy to forget to remove listeners.

This API allows safely using `AbortSignal`s in Node.js APIs by solving these
two issues by listening to the event such that `stopImmediatePropagation` does
not prevent the listener from running.

Returns a disposable so that it may be unsubscribed from more easily.

```js
import { addAbortListener } from 'node:events';

function example(signal) {
  let disposable;
  try {
    signal.addEventListener('abort', (e) => e.stopImmediatePropagation());
    disposable = addAbortListener(signal, (e) => {
      // Do something when signal is aborted.
    });
  } finally {
    disposable?.[Symbol.dispose]();
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

### getEventListeners

`Static` **getEventListeners**(`emitter`, `name`): `Function`[]

Returns a copy of the array of listeners for the event named `eventName`.

For `EventEmitter`s this behaves exactly the same as calling `.listeners` on
the emitter.

For `EventTarget`s this is the only way to get the event listeners for the
event target. This is useful for debugging and diagnostic purposes.

```js
import { getEventListeners, EventEmitter } from 'node:events';

{
  const ee = new EventEmitter();
  const listener = () => console.log('Events are fun');
  ee.on('foo', listener);
  console.log(getEventListeners(ee, 'foo')); // [ [Function: listener] ]
}
{
  const et = new EventTarget();
  const listener = () => console.log('Events are fun');
  et.addEventListener('foo', listener);
  console.log(getEventListeners(et, 'foo')); // [ [Function: listener] ]
}
```

#### Parameters

| Name |
| :------ |
| `emitter` | [`EventEmitter`](../interfaces/EventEmitter-1.md) \| [`_DOMEventTarget`](../interfaces/DOMEventTarget.md) |
| `name` | `string` \| `symbol` |

### getMaxListeners

`Static` **getMaxListeners**(`emitter`): `number`

Returns the currently set max amount of listeners.

For `EventEmitter`s this behaves exactly the same as calling `.getMaxListeners` on
the emitter.

For `EventTarget`s this is the only way to get the max event listeners for the
event target. If the number of event handlers on a single EventTarget exceeds
the max set, the EventTarget will print a warning.

```js
import { getMaxListeners, setMaxListeners, EventEmitter } from 'node:events';

{
  const ee = new EventEmitter();
  console.log(getMaxListeners(ee)); // 10
  setMaxListeners(11, ee);
  console.log(getMaxListeners(ee)); // 11
}
{
  const et = new EventTarget();
  console.log(getMaxListeners(et)); // 10
  setMaxListeners(11, et);
  console.log(getMaxListeners(et)); // 11
}
```

#### Parameters

const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();
myEmitter.on('event', () => {});
myEmitter.on('event', () => {});
console.log(listenerCount(myEmitter, 'event'));
// Prints: 2
```

#### Parameters

### on

`Static` **on**(`emitter`, `eventName`, `options?`): [`AsyncIterableIterator`](../interfaces/AsyncIterableIterator.md)<`any`\>

```js
import { on, EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
import process from 'node:process';

const ee = new EventEmitter();

// Emit later on
process.nextTick(() => {
  ee.emit('foo', 'bar');
  ee.emit('foo', 42);
});

for await (const event of on(ee, 'foo')) {
  // The execution of this inner block is synchronous and it
  // processes one event at a time (even with await). Do not use
  // if concurrent execution is required.
  console.log(event); // prints ['bar'] [42]
}
// Unreachable here
```

Returns an `AsyncIterator` that iterates `eventName` events. It will throw
if the `EventEmitter` emits `'error'`. It removes all listeners when
exiting the loop. The `value` returned by each iteration is an array
composed of the emitted event arguments.

An `AbortSignal` can be used to cancel waiting on events:

```js
import { on, EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
import process from 'node:process';

const ac = new AbortController();

(async () => {
  const ee = new EventEmitter();

  // Emit later on
  process.nextTick(() => {
    ee.emit('foo', 'bar');
    ee.emit('foo', 42);
  });

  for await (const event of on(ee, 'foo', { signal: ac.signal })) {
    // The execution of this inner block is synchronous and it
    // processes one event at a time (even with await). Do not use
    // if concurrent execution is required.
    console.log(event); // prints ['bar'] [42]
  }
  // Unreachable here
})();

process.nextTick(() => ac.abort());
```

#### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| `emitter` | [`EventEmitter`](../interfaces/EventEmitter-1.md) |
| `eventName` | `string` | The name of the event being listened for |
| `options?` | [`StaticEventEmitterOptions`](../interfaces/StaticEventEmitterOptions.md) |

### once

`Static` **once**(`emitter`, `eventName`, `options?`): `Promise`<`any`[]\>

Creates a `Promise` that is fulfilled when the `EventEmitter` emits the given
event or that is rejected if the `EventEmitter` emits `'error'` while waiting.
The `Promise` will resolve with an array of all the arguments emitted to the
given event.

This method is intentionally generic and works with the web platform [EventTarget](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-eventtarget) interface, which has no special`'error'` event
semantics and does not listen to the `'error'` event.

```js
import { once, EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
import process from 'node:process';

const ee = new EventEmitter();

process.nextTick(() => {
  ee.emit('myevent', 42);
});

const [value] = await once(ee, 'myevent');
console.log(value);

const err = new Error('kaboom');
process.nextTick(() => {
  ee.emit('error', err);
});

try {
  await once(ee, 'myevent');
} catch (err) {
  console.error('error happened', err);
}
```

The special handling of the `'error'` event is only used when `events.once()`is used to wait for another event. If `events.once()` is used to wait for the
'`error'` event itself, then it is treated as any other kind of event without
special handling:

```js
import { EventEmitter, once } from 'node:events';

const ee = new EventEmitter();

once(ee, 'error')
  .then(([err]) => console.log('ok', err.message))
  .catch((err) => console.error('error', err.message));

ee.emit('error', new Error('boom'));

// Prints: ok boom
```

An `AbortSignal` can be used to cancel waiting for the event:

```js
import { EventEmitter, once } from 'node:events';

const ee = new EventEmitter();
const ac = new AbortController();

async function foo(emitter, event, signal) {
  try {
    await once(emitter, event, { signal });
    console.log('event emitted!');
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === 'AbortError') {
      console.error('Waiting for the event was canceled!');
    } else {
      console.error('There was an error', error.message);
    }
  }
}

foo(ee, 'foo', ac.signal);
ac.abort(); // Abort waiting for the event
ee.emit('foo'); // Prints: Waiting for the event was canceled!
```

#### Parameters
