# Experimental Features

This section of the documentation includes features that are currently experimental. As Medusa moves towards modularization, more documentation pages will be added to this section.

This includes:

- Orchestration tools, shipped as NPM packages, that facilitate building custom digital commerce spanning multiple systems. For example, Workflows.
- Commerce Modules that ship isolated commerce functionalities as NPM packages.

## Experimental Features in the Medusa Backend

Experimental Features are guarded in the Medusa backend by a feature flag.

To use them, [enable the `medusa_v2` feature flag](../development/feature-flags/toggle.md) in your backend.
