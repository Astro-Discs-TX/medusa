In this guide, you'll learn about the managed Redis service that Cloud provides as part of your project environments.

## Managed Redis Service

Cloud offers a managed Redis service for your project environments. Each environment has its own dedicated Redis instance that is automatically provisioned when the environment is created.

So, when you create a new project, Cloud creates a production Redis instance for the production environment. If you create a staging environment, Cloud creates a separate Redis instance for that environment as well.

## Configured Redis Infrastructure Modules

Cloud automatically configures your Medusa application to use Redis-based Infrastructure Modules, including:

- [Redis Event Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/event/redis)
- [Redis Cache Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/cache/redis)
- [Redis Locking Module Provider](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/locking/redis)
- [Redis Workflow Engine Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/workflow-engine/redis)

So, you don't need to configure any of these modules and providers or set up Redis manually. Also, if you have them configured in `medusa-config.ts`, remove them to avoid conflicts.

<Note>

If you're using a Medusa version before v2.7.0, [contact support](#) for assistance in configuring the Redis modules.

</Note>

### Override Redis Configurations

If you need to customize the Redis configurations for any of the Redis modules and providers, you must host and manage your own Redis instance externally.

Then, configure the modules and providers you're overriding in your `medusa-config.ts` file to connect to your external Redis instance. Refer to the documentation for each module for more details on how to configure it.

<Note title="Tip">

To set the connection URL of your external Redis instance, refer to the [Environments](../environments/page.mdx#add-environment-variables) guide to learn how to add environment variables. You can then use these variables in your `medusa-config.ts` file to connect to your Redis instance.
