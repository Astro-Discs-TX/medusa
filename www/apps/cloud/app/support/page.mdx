In this guide, you'll learn how to receive support as a Cloud user.

## Cloud Support

Based on your Cloud plan, you can receive support from our team and get access to a solutions engineer.

Our support offering helps you troubleshoot issues, get help with setup, and get guidance on building custom features. Our support team is here to assist you from development to production.

There are two main ways to contact support: through the Cloud dashboard or through Slack.

## Contact Support via Cloud

You can find a <InlineIcon Icon={QuestionMarkCircle} alt="question" /> icon at the top right of the Cloud dashboard. Click on it to open the support form.

In the support form, you can provide a subject and a description of your issue. You can also attach files to help our team understand the problem better.

Use this form to report bugs in Cloud, request help with using the Cloud dashboard, or ask for general assistance.

<Note>

For reporting bugs in the Medusa core application, open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/issues/new/choose).

</Note>

Make sure to provide as many details as possible about your issue to receive the best assistance.
