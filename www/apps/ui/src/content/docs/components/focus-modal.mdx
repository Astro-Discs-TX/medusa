## Controlling Open State

---

If you want to control whether the Focus Modal is open, you have to pass the `FocusModal` component the following props:

1. Set `defaultOpen` to `false` to ensure it's not open by default.
2. Set `open` to your value. Typically, this would be a state value that can be changed by the function provided to `onOpenChange`.
3. Set `onOpenChange` to the function that changes the open value. Typically, this would be a state function that changes the value provided to `open`. If this prop is not provided, the Focus Modal will not open or close as expected.

For example:

```tsx
import { useState } from "react"

const MyModal = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <FocusModal 
      defaultOpen={false} 
      open={open} 
      onOpenChange={setOpen}
    >
      <FocusModal.Trigger>Trigger</FocusModal.Trigger>
      <FocusModal.Content>
        <FocusModal.Header>Title</FocusModal.Header>
        <FocusModal.Body>Content</FocusModal.Body>
      </FocusModal.Content>
    </FocusModal>
  )
}
```
