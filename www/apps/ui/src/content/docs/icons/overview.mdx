## Icon Props
---

Icons accept all props that an `svg` element accepts.

### Icon Color

By default, outline icons' stroke color and solid icon's fill color are set to `currentColor`.

You can set a different color by passing the `color` prop.

<ComponentExample name="icon-color" />

You can also use a CSS class by passing the `className` prop.

<ComponentExample name="icon-color-classes" />

### Icon Size

By default, icons' width and height are `20px`.

You can pass the `width` or `height` props to change the icon's size.

<ComponentExample name="icon-size-props" />

You can also pass Tailwind CSS width or height classes in the `className` prop.

<ComponentExample name="icon-size-classes" />
