# Medusa Admin: 1.0.0

Medusa Admin has been moved from a standalone repository to our mono-repository to centralise projects and ship it as an NPM package.

## Overview

The NPM package name is `@medusajs/admin-ui` and in our core repository the UI can be found within `packages/admin-ui`. 

This guide will cover three cases where the move might affect your current setup:

- Updating your existing project to use the plugin
- Replacing your already deployed admin with the plugin
- Preserving customizations in the plugin

## Actions required

**Updating your existing project to use the plugin**

As mentioned, Medusa Admin is now distributed via NPM and installed as a plugins. To replace your existing admin, you first need to install the plugin in your Medusa server project.

Follow our quickstart guide [INSERT LINK] to get started setting up the plugin.

**Replacing your already deployed admin with the plugin**

The move to an NPM package has implications for the workflow to deploy the admin. You can still use a platform like Vercel or Netlify to host the project, but that requires you to eject the admin system from the plugin instead of serving it on the server.

Refer to our guide on deploying to Vercel [INSERT LINK] to see an example of the new workflow. The same steps apply to most hosting platforms. 

**Preserving customizations in the plugin**

To keep your custom components or general changes to Medusa Admin, you have to eject the admin system from the plugin instead of serving it on the server.

Refer to our guide on deploying to Vercel [INSERT LINK] to learn how to eject the admin.

There’s currently no seamless way to extend the admin plugin, but it is part of our roadmap for next quarter. 

> It is highly recommended to not customize your admin project heavily while there’s no native extensibility workflows.

The new admin package in `packages/admin-ui` likely contains changes, that are not part of your own project nor the standalone admin repository. Therefore, to ensure your admin has the latest changes and your custom work, you have to do a comparison between your project and the `packages/admin-ui` and resolve the conflicts.
