# v1.8

Medusa v1.8 comes with many new features while introducing architectural changes contributing toward making Medusa more modular and portable to new, modern environments. 

This has led to breaking changes and this document will guide you through the required actions.

## Required Actions

### Step 1: Update Typeorm

To get started using Medusa v1.8, you first need to upgrade your version of Typeorm:

```
yarn add typeorm@latest

```

The dependency on Typeorm has been upgraded from 0.2.31 to 0.3.11, which comes with significant breaking changes. Follow our Typeorm upgrade guide [INSERT LINK] dedicated toward helping you refactor your custom Typeorm implementations.

Install version 1.8 of the core:

```
yarn add @medusajs/medusa@latest

```

The core engine does not come with a Redis caching mechanism and Redis events system any longer. Instead the core relies on the Module API for those two sub-systems. 

As a result, you are required to install and use those modules to ensure your application works as expected.

Install the new Redis cache module with the following command:

```
yarn add @medusajs/cache-redis@latest

```

Install the new Redis event bus module with the following command:

```
yarn add @medusajs/event-bus-redis@latest

```

Both modules need configuration. In `medusa-config.js`, add the following to your export:

```jsx
module.exports = {
  projectConfig: {
    database_url: DATABASE_URL,
    ...
  },
  plugins,
  // Add modules configuration
  modules: {
    eventBus: {
      resolve: "@medusajs/event-bus-redis",
      options: {
        redisUrl: "your-redis-url"
      }
    },
    cacheService: {
      resolve: "@medusajs/cache-redis",
      options: {
        redisUrl: "your-redis-url"
      }
    }
  }
};

```

Finally, you should run migrations to ensure your database is up to date with our schema changes:

```
medusa migrations run

```

You are now set up to start using 1.8.
