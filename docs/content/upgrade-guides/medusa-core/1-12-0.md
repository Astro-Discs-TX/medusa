# v1.12.0

Version 1.12.0 of Medusa comes with database changes that require you run the migrations command and a minor breaking change to the `PriceSelectionStrategy`.

## Overview

This release contains migrations that introduce a range of new database indexes that will improve performance of your setup.

Additionally, it brings minor breaking changes to the `PriceSelectionStrategy`. The method `calculateVariantPrice` now supports bulk calculating variant prices.

Specifically, the following signature has changed:

```ts
// Before
class MyStrategy extends 
  AbstractPriceSelectionStrategy {
  // ...
  calculateVariantPrice(variantId: string, context: PriceSelectionContext): Promise<PriceSelectionResult> {
    //...
  }
}
```

```ts
// Now
class MyStrategy extends 
  AbstractPriceSelectionStrategy {
  // ...
  calculateVariantPrice(data: {
    variantId: string; 
    quantity?: number;
   }[],
   context: PriceSelectionContext
  ): Promise<Map<string, PriceSelectionResult>>
    // ...
  }
}
```

## How to Update

Run the following command in the root directory of your Medusa Backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/medusa@1.12.0
```

To avoid unexpected issues with dependencies, it is also recommended to update all other Medusa plugins or packages you have installed.

## Actions Required

### Run Migrations

After updating your Medusa server and before running it, run the following command to run the latest migrations:

```bash
npx @medusajs/medusa-cli migrations run
```

### Change PriceSelectionStrategy method

If you've created a custom price selection strategy, or have using the `PriceSelectionStrategy`'s `calculateVariantPrice` method in your custom code, make sure to update its definition or usage based on the new signature:

```ts
class MyStrategy extends 
  AbstractPriceSelectionStrategy {
  // ...
  calculateVariantPrice(data: {
    variantId: string; 
    quantity?: number;
   }[],
   context: PriceSelectionContext
  ): Promise<Map<string, PriceSelectionResult>>
    // ...
  }
}
```

You can learn more in the [Price Selection Strategy](../../modules/price-lists/price-selection-strategy.md#calculatevariantprice-method) documentation.
