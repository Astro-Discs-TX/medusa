# v1.7.12

Version 1.7.12 of Medusa introduces some database schema changes which require running the migrations command.

## Overview​

This release contains a migration to ensure that the product_variant_inventory table is in its correct state. We mistakenly modified a column name in an already released migration, which naturally can lead to issues if the first migration has already been applied.

The issue was reported in #3379.

## Actions Required​

### Run Migrations​

After updating your Medusa server and before running it, run the following command to run the latest migrations:

```bash
medusa migrations run
```
