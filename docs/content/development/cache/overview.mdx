# Cache

In this document, you’ll learn about Cache Modules in Medusa, how they work, and which modules Medusa provides.

## Overview

Cache is used in Medusa to store the results of computations such as price selection or various tax calculations. The caching layer in Medusa is implemented as a module. This allows you to replace the underlying database/cache store in your project.

Modules are packages that, essentially, export a service. The main service exported from a cache module has to implement `ICacheService` exported from the `@medusajs/types` package.

During the app startup, the modules loader will load the service into the [dependency injection container](../fundamentals/dependency-injection.md) to be available as `cacheService` to the rest of the commerce application.

## Available Modules

Medusa default starter project comes with the in-memory cache module (`@medusajs/cache-inmemory`). In-memory cache uses a plain JS Map object to store data, which is great for testing and development purposes.

For production environments, there is the Redis cache module package (`@medusajs/cache-redis`) that you can install.

    }
  },

    href: '#',
    label: 'Memcached Module',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],

        children: 'Module coming soon'
      }
    }
  },
]} />

## Custom Development

Developers can create custom cache modules to implement their custom cache logic. The module can be installed and used in any Medusa backend.

<DocCard item={{
    type: 'link',
    href: '/development/cache/create',
    label: 'Create a Cache Module',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['academic-cap-solid'],
      description: 'Learn how to create a cache module in Medusa.'
    }
  }}
/>
