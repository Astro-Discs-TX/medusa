# Admin Dashboard Quickstart

This document will guide you through setting up the admin dashboard in the Medusa backend.

:::note

The admin dashboard is now shipped as an NPM package, and the previous GitHub repository has been deprecated.

:::

## Prerequisites

### Medusa Backend

As the admin dashboard is a plugin installed on the Medusa Backend, you must have a Medusa Backend installed first. You can learn how to install it in [this documentation](../development/backend/install.mdx).

### Node.js

The Admin uses [Vite 3](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) which requires v14.8+ or v16+ of Node.js. You can check which version of Node you have by running the following command:

```bash noReport
node -v
```

You can install Node from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

---

## Install the Admin

### Step 1: Install the Package

In the directory of your Medusa backend, run the following command to install admin dashboard:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/admin
```

### Step 2: Add Admin to Medusa Configurations

In `medusa-config.js`, add the admin plugin into the array of `plugins`:

```js title=medusa-config.js
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
    /** @type {import('@medusajs/admin').PluginOptions} */
    options: {
      // ...
    },
  },
]
```

The plugin accepts the following options:

1. `serve`: (default: `true`) a boolean indicating whether to serve the admin dashboard when the Medusa backend starts. If set to `false`, you can serve the admin dashboard as explained in [this section](#serve-the-admin-dashboard-separately).
2. `path`: (default: `app`) a string indicating the path the admin server should run on. It shouldn't be prefixed or suffixed with a slash `/`, and it can't be one of the reserved paths: "admin" and "store".
3. `outDir`: Optional path for where to output the admin build files.
4. `autoRebuild`: (default: `false`) a boolean indicating whether the admin UI should be rebuilt if there are any changes or if a missing build is detected when the backend starts. If not set, you must [manually build the admin dashboard](#optional-manually-building-admin-dashboard).

### Optional: Manually Building Admin Dashboard

If you have `autoRebuild` disabled, you must build your admin dashboard before starting the Medusa backend. Manually building the admin dashboard can also be useful in other cases, such as when you update to a newer version of `@medusajs/admin`.

You can add the following script to `package.json` which manually builds the admin:

```json title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    // other scripts...
    "build:admin": "medusa-admin build"
  }
}
```

Then, you can build the admin dashboard by running the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build:admin
```

### Step 3: Test the Admin Dashboard

:::tip

If you disabled the `serve` option, you need to serve the admin dashboard separately as explained in [this section](#serve-the-admin-dashboard-separately).

:::

You can test the admin dashboard by running the following command in the directory of the Medusa backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run start
```

This starts the Medusa Backend and the admin dashboard. By default, the admin will be available on the URL `localhost:9000/app`. If you set the `path` option, then the admin will be available on `localhost:9000/<PATH>` with `<PATH>` being the value of the `path` option.

## Serve the Admin Dashboard Separately

If you have the `serve` option set to `false`, or if you need to serve the admin dashboard separately from the Medusa backend, add the following script to `package.json`:

```json title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    // other scripts...
    "serve:admin": "medusa-admin dev"
  }
}
```

This runs the admin dashboard on `localhost:7001`.

:::tip

You still need to run the Medusa backend as the admin dashboard uses its APIs.

:::

### Change Port

You can change the default port (`7001`) that the admin dashboard runs on by passing a `--port` or `-p` option to the command:

```json title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    // other scripts...
    "serve:admin": "medusa-admin dev --port 8000"
  }
}
```

### Change Medusa Backend URL

You can change the default Medusa backend URL (`http://localhost:9000`) that the admin uses to interact with the backend's APIs by passing a `--backend` or `-b` option to the command:

```json title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    // other scripts...
    "serve:admin": "medusa-admin dev --backend example.com"
  }
}
```

---

## Demo Credentials

If you installed the demo data when you installed the Medusa backend by using the `--seed` option or running:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run seed
```

You can use the email `admin@medusa-test.com` and password `supersecret` to log in.

:::info

Passwords in Medusa are hashed using the [scrypt-kdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrypt-kdf). The password hash is then stored in the database.

:::

---

## Create a New Admin User

To create a new admin user from the command line, run the following command in the directory holding your Medusa backend:

```bash
medusa user -e some@email.com -p some-password
```

This will create a new user that you can use to log into your admin panel.

## Admin User Guide

The admin dashboard provides a lot of ecommerce features including managing Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) flows, store settings, products, orders, and much more.

You can learn more about the admin dashboard and its features in the [User Guide](../user-guide.mdx).
