# Medusa Admin Quickstart

This document will guide you through setting up the Medusa admin dashboard.

:::note

Medusa Admin is now shipped as an NPM package and the previous GitHub repository has been deprecated.

:::

## Prerequisites

### Medusa Backend

As the Medusa Admin is essentially a plugin installed on the Medusa Backend, you must have a Medusa Backend installed first. You can learn how to install it in [this documentation](../development/backend/install.mdx).

### Node.js

As Medusa Admin uses [Vite 3](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project), it requires versions 14.8+ or 16+. You can check which version of Node you have by running the following command:

```bash noReport
node -v
```

You can install Node from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

---

## Install the Admin

### Step 1: Install the Package

In the directory of your Medusa backend, run the following command to install Medusa Admin:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/admin
```

### Step 2: Add to Medusa Configurations

In `medusa-config.js`, add the Medusa Admin plugin into the array of `plugins`:

```js title=medusa-config.js
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
    /** @type {import('@medusajs/admin').PluginOptions} */
    options: {
      //...
    },
  },
]
```

The plugin accepts the following options:

1. `serve`: (default: `true`) whether to serve the admin dashboard when the Medusa backend starts.
2. `path`: (default: `app`) the path the admin server should run on. It should not be prefixed or suffixed with a slash, and it cannot be one of the reserved paths: "admin" and "store".
3. `outDir`: Optional path for where to output the admin build files.
4. `autoRebuild`: (default: `false`) whether the admin UI should be rebuilt if there are any changes or if a missing build is detected when the backend starts.

### Step 3: Run Medusa Admin

To run the Medusa Admin, you can simply start the Medusa Backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run start
```

By default, the admin will be available on the URL `localhost:9000/app`. If you set the `path` option, then the admin will be available on `localhost:9000/<PATH>` with `<PATH>` being the value of the `path` option.

If you run into errors during the installation, check out [this troubleshooting guide](../troubleshooting/common-installation-errors.mdx).

## Demo Credentials

If you installed the demo data when you installed the Medusa backend by using the `--seed` option or running:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run seed
```

You can use the email `admin@medusa-test.com` and password `supersecret` to log in.

:::info

Passwords in Medusa are hashed using the [scrypt-kdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrypt-kdf). The password hash is then stored in the database.

:::

---

## Create a New Admin User

To create a new admin user from the command line, run the following command in the directory holding your Medusa backend:

```bash
medusa user -e some@email.com -p some-password
```

This will create a new user that you can use to log into your admin panel.

---

## Manually Building Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard is built automatically the first time you run the backend and if you have enabled the `autoRebuild` option, which rebuilds the admin dashboard whenever you make changes while the backend is running.

In some case it's useful to manually build the admin dashboard, such as when you update to a newer version of `@medusajs/admin`, or if the `autoRebuild` option is disabled.

You can add the following script to `package.json` which manually builds the admin:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // other scripts...
    "build:admin": "medusa-admin build"
  }
}
```

After that, you can manually build the admin dashboard by running the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build:admin
```
